This event is one of the biggest fundraisers to support the work of Sherry's Hope. A cancer diagnosis and treatment can be devastating to a family and thanks to the support of the community, we are able to provide help and hope during a difficult time.\n\nSherry's Hope also works to educate our community on colorectal health.

    "\"We are the voice for the voiceless.\" \n\ufffdHope Lives Here Animal Rescue Society (HLH) is a non-profit animal rescue founded in 2012. We are committed to rescuing stray, abandoned, and unwanted dogs and cats from Alberta urban and rural areas, including First Nations surrounding Edmonton and Red Deer, to then place them in permanent homes. HLH created a spay/neuter initiative program within the communities we work with to help curb the overpopulation of unwanted dogs and cats. Our organization works with field volunteers in several rural communities across Alberta to rescue dogs and cats in need. Unfortunately, for every dog we save, there are at-least 10 more requiring immediate rescue, and in the case of cats, at least 30 more requiring rescue - without foster space we cannot rescue them.\n\nHope Lives Here Animal Rescue Society received their Certificate of Incorporation on November 30, 2012 and became recognized as a Registered Charity. \n\nWe do our best to keep our operating costs low, allowing us to assist more animals.

Supplies such as leashes, collars, toys, dishes, food, litter, treats, and kennels are provided to our foster homes.\n\nA loving, safe and lifelong home is the goal in Hope Lives Here Animal Rescue Society's rehoming efforts; therefore, a multi-step adoption process is followed to ensure the best match possible between the needs of the animal and the lifestyle of the potential adopters. Many of HLH adoptable animals have been rescued from harsh situation; therefore, they are adopted out as companion animals to be loved and protected for the rest of their lives.

    "Islam has a centuries long tradition of inspiring its adherents to contribute to humanity based on conviction in its tenets. Previous generations of Muslims were on the forefront of contributing to medicine, philosophy, architecture, and governance among other areas. We are an institute aiming to rekindle this tradition.\n\nConstant negative portrayals of Islam have put Muslims in a defensive position in which they constantly have to justify their convictions, while fighting off the natural doubts and insecurities that arise in such a climate. As such, young Muslims should be intellectually equipped and spiritually anchored in a way that empowers them to deal with the onslaught of doubt-inducing claims routinely leveled against Islam.\n\nWe aim to actively participate in the current day discourse touching on all topics that are related to establishing conviction in the hearts and minds of young Muslims. The institute aims to be the trusted source regarding these topics by generating well researched Islamic content that is then distilled through various formats including articles, infographics, animations, videos, and cutting edge app technology. This content is then carefully assembled into curricula that can be used by various educators and community leaders to help anchor young Muslims in their faith, and produce thoughtful societal contribution.\n\nThe Institute is a non-profit research initiative that will make all of its content free and accessible. This will allow everyone looking for answers, and those tasked with giving answers, to always have a comprehensive resource readily available to them.\n\nWe believe that telling our own story is the only way to counter the narrative that has been forced upon our community.\n\nOur Areas of Focus\nWe aim to address relevant topics head-on with the help of the foremost experts in this space. Our work concentrates in the following areas:\n\nDismantling Doubts\nWhat Islam isn\u2019t. Refuting claims made against Islam, contextualizing texts or issues that have been problematized by Islamophobes, and offering frameworks to refute common misconceptions.\n\nNurturing Conviction\nWhat Islam is. Offering content on how to spiritually and intellectually anchor and strengthen belief. This involves an Islamic equivalent to systematic theology. The goal is to build creed by reintroducing Allah and His Messenger to people, instilling strong faith in divine texts, rooting Iman in the hearts, and offering spiritual guidance on how to practice in a way that keeps those roots nourished.\n\nInspiring Contribution\nWhat Islam does. Telling the story of Islam properly historically and in the present. Reclaiming the glorious past of contribution, while contextualizing when Muslims fell short of Islamic goals. This also includes discussions on ethics: What is unique about what Islam can give to the world today in the unique sense. This represents the branches and fruits of the tree of faith that provide shade and benefit to humanity.": 1,
    "Background\n\nWith increase in poverty and attendant malnutrition worsened by lack of access to quality health care, the increase in human mortalities and morbidities have become alarming in Nigeria and other developing countries in the last five years. Various reports have repeatedly cited Nigeria to be home to largest concentration of people living below $1per day.\n\nAs a matter of fact, over 80% of Nigeria\u2019s 170 million population fall within this bracket. This has resulted in widespread infant and maternal mortalities as well as shortened live expectancy. With the country currently in economic recession, this situation is bound to deteriorate as the Authorities at the Federal, State or Local levels are yet to figure out an action plan to curtail the economic challenge. Typically, the simplest response is to lament, criticize or be indifferent to this malady while a large segment of the population is being wiped out. The demographic structure of Nigeria\u2019s population shows that over 70% are between 15- 40years old. This segment are the worst victims of a failed healthcare system. This means that a bulk of the nation\u2019s working population is being decimated due to inaction, corruption, wrong policy formulation and implementation. It was in response to this that Health Emergency Initiative {HEI) came into being on October 24th 2015. Health Emergency Initiative (HEI) is a Non-Governmental Organization registered in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is a group of passionate individuals who completely dislike the manner in which children from indigent parents die in most public hospitals within the country. The vision was borne when it was discovered that parent of a child admitted into one of the hospitals within the country could not afford about N5000 for medical prescriptions and as the result, the child died within days. Efforts towards health advocacy and influencing legislative outcomes by various Groups in the past fizzled out due to weak institutional framework and lack of political will.\n\nOUR VISION\n\n\u201cTo be a leading global platform that provides health intervention to indigent and vulnerable people in the society, driven by the love of Jesus Christ\u201d\n\nOur Aims & Objectives:\n\n1. To promote quick, initial and instant financial cover or assistance for indigent patients who are unable to provide immediate funds necessary to undergo treatment and preliminary hospitalization prior to regular family assistance.\n\n2. To provide short term assistance to accident victims in need of emergency medical care but cannot afford same or whose relatives are yet to be reached.\n\n3. Identify and assist indigent patients (including pregnant women) who are unable to foot their medical bills before and after they have been treated (medical detention). This may involve paying part or all of the bills.\n\n4. In the medium to long term, collaborate with hospitals, clinics and maternity homes etc to ensure health emergency issues are not arbitrarily turned down without recourse to HEI provided the patient/victim is not associated with criminality, deception or cheating.\n\n5. Undertake medical outreach to slums, rural and destitute communities aimed at free and subsidized access to healthcare services.\n\n6. Collate, maintain and provide periodic health related data to government agencies/bodies, donor groups, individuals and charity minded members of the public with a view to curtailing, minimizing and eradicating careless deaths arising from emergencies.\n\n7. Partner with Health Management Organizations (HMOs) towards providing basic health insurance scheme to the indigent segment of the population.\n\n8. Promote and support health related research initiatives for the good of humanity.\n\n9. Liaise with Medical Groups Locally, internationally and in Diaspora such as Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Nurses Guild, Doctors Without Borders, the Red cross Society, the World Health Organization (WHO,) to provide free and/or discounted healthcare delivery to the citizenry(poor citizenry/lowest segment of the society).\n\n10. Grant access to members of the public information on Health related literature towards disease prevention and eradication.\n\n11. Establish Disease Detection/Diagnosis Centres such as Cancer/Diabetes etc across regions/geography.\n\n12. Promote Health Advocacy programmes and collaborate with relevant stakeholders to influence legislations and policies to ensure the indigent and vulnerable have access to affordable and free healthcare.\n\n13. Support and promote Initiatives and Groups working towards the operation of modern and well equipped hospitals/medical outfits operated by experts.\n\n14. To assist in the educational development and rehabilitation of indigent children, youths and those in need especially person that received the INITIATIVE\u2019s medical support.\n\n15. To promote various initiatives towards the educational and/or vocational development of the boy/girl child particularly indigent ones who hitherto benefited medically from.\n\n16. Any other health related programmes and initiatives especially as they relate to emergency health issues.\n\nSources of Funding\n\nHEI operates by members pooling their individual funds into a dedicated account. Members are free to deposit into the HEI account any amount of their choice without compulsion or coercion. This account is managed following strict quality management principles, lean concepts and accountability. Within a very short period of her existence, pooled funds have amounted from hundreds of thousands to over N4.5million.\n\nTill date the principal source of funding is monthly/quarterly/periodic contributions/donations by members who felt inspired by the various ways the Group has touched the life of indigent patients. These contributions range from as low as N1,000.00 a month to N50,000.00 or more monthly on voluntary basis. To enhance financial integrity, a quarterly financial report is generated and shared among members. It captures details of income, expenditure and cash/bank balances. The reports are available for perusal.\n\nHEI Interventions and Medical Support Based on the positive impact which the Group has made within her short period of existence on the lives of several indigent patients admitted either at the primary, secondary and tertiary health facilities, membership has grown to hundreds of passionate people with the same vision . The outcome of this initiative has been very impressive. Some of which are :- children who ordinarily would have died from their medical challenges have been cured, discharged and went home; thereby putting smiles on the faces of their parents. Bills which ordinarily led to keeping many patients in medical detention have been paid and the concerned patients discharged home. Expensive drugs have been purchased for parents who could not afford same for their children and medical outcomes altered positively.\n\nIn appreciation of these interventions, top hospital management of various hospitals have written and appreciated the organization for her great impact on the lives of the indigent hospital clients.\n\nDue to limited funding, most of the indigent cases intervened/supported by HEI are within the threshold of N20,0000.00 ($60) and below.\n\nThis is also aimed at ensuring more destitute and vulnerable patients are assisted and for quick penetration. However, there have been other instances where this cap has been exceeded to ensure end to end completion of the patient\u2019s treatment.\n\n \n\nAs at April 2017, over 105 indigent and vulnerable patients/sick people have benefited from HEI interventions/assistance Public Hospitals Where HEI has Intervened/Assisted:\n\n\u2022 Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH\n\n\u2022 University College Hospital Ibadan, UCH\n\n\u2022 Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH\n\n\u2022 Lagos Island Maternity\n\n\u2022 Lagos General Hospital\n\n\u2022 Gbagada General Hospital, Lagos\n\n\u2022 Mushin General Hospital, Lagos\n\n\u2022 Randle General Hospital, Surulere, Lagos\n\n\u2022 Isolo General Hospital, Lagos\n\n\u2022 Ajeromi General Hospital Ajegunle\n\n\u2022 Shomolu General Hospital, Shomolu\n\n\u2022 Police Medical Clinic Falomo\n\n\u2022 Apapa General Hospital\n\n\u2022 Alimosho General Hospital, Igando\n\n\u2022 Agege General Hospital\n\n\u2022 Federal Medical Centre Ebutte Metta\n\n\u2022 Ebutte Metta Health Centre\n\n\u2022 Badagry General Hospital\n\n\u2022 Massey Children Hospital\n\nAreas of Collaboration/Outlook\n\nHEI is willing to partner and collaborate with individuals, Groups and Institutions under a strong ethical framework that would bring succor to indigent communities across the Globe. In additions to its usual daily and weekly interventions in public hospitals, HEI is currently embarking of a project to bring succour to critically injured Road Accident Victims. The Project tagged \u201cNone should die\u201d in collaboration with Federal Road Safety Corps and selected Public Hospitals in Lagos would further help in saving mores lives especially for accident victims. The focal point is to ensure that accident victims in Critical condition brought in /rescued by FRSC officials are stabilized by Selected public hospitals to the tune of N20,000.00 to be settled by HEI. The assurance that the bill would be settled would ensure the hospitals are not reluctant to attend to the victims. Thereafter, diligent efforts would be made to contact relatives of the victims for continuity of treatment especially for the ones exceeding the N20,000.00 threshold.\n\n\u201cSomewhere in the heart of men is the seed to do good. We only have to water this seed, that it may grow, flourish and spread its loving foliage over all in need.\u201d Anonymous\n\nIf you would like to SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS TO SAVE LIVES BY PAYING THE HOSPITAL BILLS OF INDIGENT ACCIDENT VICTIMS NATIONWIDE, KINDLY CALL 08035766767 for more information.\n\nWe can also be contacted on our Official and only Facebook page: Health Emergency Initiative\n\nInstagram: @healthemergencyinitiative\n\nWhatsapp: 08037228843\n\nTwitter: @initiativeHe": 1,

    "Help from Bournemouth to Ukraine turns international to become Ukraine Relief\n\nFollowing overwhelming support from Bournemouth residents and businesses, Help from Bournemouth to Ukraine has grown to receive national and international support from the whole of the UK, Europe, Canada and the USA. The momentous shift in support has inspired the charity to change its name to Ukraine Relief to become an \u2018international army of hope\u2019.\n\nLaunched in February 2022 by Karol Swiacki, the group quickly gathered support as residents of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole donated items, time, and money to help the hundreds of thousands who have been forced to leave their homes and belongings to flee the conflict in Ukraine. Donations poured into the group\u2019s warehouses at Castlepoint, Hurn Airport and Poole. What started as a small group of 100 volunteers in Bournemouth has now become an organised international network, with hubs across the south of England, Poland and Ukraine.\n\nKarol Swiacki comments: \u201cWhat makes us so effective is our ability to get urgent aid directly to where it is most needed. For those looking for a way to support the Ukrainian people, we have a logistics network running directly from our hubs in the UK all the way to eastern Ukraine.\u201d\n\nKarol adds: \u201cThis started as a small group of volunteers with massive support from the people of Bournemouth and the surrounding areas. It\u2019s now grown into something international, we\u2019ve been overwhelmed by people\u2019s generosity, and by how quickly this has grown. We really want to thank the community in Bournemouth, as without them, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten to where we are now, it all started with their support.\u201d Ukraine Relief\u2019s mission is to be the UK\u2019s most effective Ukrainian relief effort and to ensure the maximum impact for every item and every pound donated. From logistical to financial to material contributions, Ukraine Relief welcomes a wide range of support from businesses and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are now asking businesses and individuals looking to make a real difference on the ground in Ukraine to contact us \u2013 whether you can donate money or goods, we can get essential supplies directly to where they are needed the most,\u201d says Karol. \u201cOur partners in Ukraine, including city mayors, local authorities and charities, are regularly updating us on the latest items and support required.\u201d Karol continues \u201cFrom clothing, food and toiletries, all the way through to communications and medical equipment. Financial donations allow us to source essential supplies and provide direct support. Our impact depends on getting what people really need to them as quickly as we can, and people\u2019s generous contributions are helping us to do exactly that.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery pound, every hour, every donation really does make a huge difference to the lives of those that have been torn apart by this awful war. We want the people of Ukraine to know that the UK is with them, we have not forgotten them.\u201d\n\nVisit www.ukrainerelief.org.uk to find out how you can help.": 1
