New Jersey born, MBA, JD, Master Mason and a tireless advocate for the homeless and low income who are seeking disability benefits. It's simple, if you are within the law's requirements for disability benefits, you get a check every month, and health insurance. No, it doesn't include a new iPhone, house or cool car, but, with your SSI/SSDI disability backpay, you can potentially get those things...with your own disability money :-). I created this channel because of how many crazy things I was hearing out in the general public on how this system works. I did library seminars, academia seminars, food truck seminars (which I prefer), etc...The online video platform is the best way to reach the majority of you guys. \n\n#disabilitybenefits #socialsecurity #disabilityattorney #live #disabilitylaw #disabilityinformation #SSI #SSDI #RSDI #SSD\n\n|=============FREE CASE EVALUATION================|\n\nCall 407-279-1754 (my personal line\u2026if I don\u2019t pick up, leave a message and a staff member will call you back); \nor email:  wrh@disabilityresolution.com\n\n|================CONTACT LAW FIRM================|\n\nDisability Resolution, P.A.

    "Hello friends,\nDuring this world cancer week I'm trying to create awareness about the need for hair. Cancer patients require hair donators to make wig after their treatment starts. Hair loss at a very young age can stop them from coming out of home and make them depressed. Let's donate our hair and give them hope to step out of home.. We are not giving money, it's just hair, it'll grow back..Those who are planning to cut can come forward and donate for a good cause.\n\nIf you are interested in donating your hair, please contact them through the following ways:\n\nFollow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/KPEOyM4xzSjKjA2Ic6Lxs3.    \n  Intrested people can join this group and send your details about hair donation.\n\nMail id: hairdonating@gmail.com\n\nInsta profile: https://instagram.com/hairdonating?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nFacebook profile :\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100017245487378&mibextid=ZbWKwL\n\nAfter cutting you hair, send the courier of yout cut hair to the following address \ud83d\udc47\n\nTo\u00a0\n Psycho oncology department (The Director)\nAdyar cancer institute\nNo 38 sardar patel road\nAdyar\nChennai 600036\nContact number of donate hair give hope organization : +91 82483 23098\n\nPlease contact them before cutting your hair because without information thry will not receive the parcel.\n\nFor more details on how to donate your hair for cancer patients, kindly watch the full video on hair donation.

The tone will change pitch and sound longer the stronger the motion that is detected.\n\nThe lower graph (black line) will show smaller motion. Either smaller local quakes or larger more distant earthquakes. The graph is set to a fixed scale. The larger the motion detected, the more the graph will be filled.\n\nThe graph above the lower graph (blue line) is a variable scale graph.  The graph's scale will shrink and grow as the signal level changes.\n\nThe color graph is a Spectrogram. This is a different way to view the same seismic data.

The British prime minister also announced on Friday a new security agreement between the two countries that would 'last a hundred years or more'. At a news conference with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Sunak added that the UK and other European countries could not falter in their support for Ukraine because 'if Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there'.\nSubscribe to Guardian News on YouTube \u25ba http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub\n\nThe Guardian publishes independent journalism, made possible by supporters.

The largest collection of tutorial videos on how to win your fully favorable SSI and SSDI benefits exists right here: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0ssadisabilitybenefitsvideosattorney\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowdy guys, my name is Attorney Walter Rudolph Hnot, III. New Jersey born, MBA, JD, Master Mason and a tireless advocate for the homeless and low income who are seeking disability benefits. It's simple, if you are within the law's requirements for disability benefits, you get a check every month, and health insurance. No, it doesn't include a new iPhone, house or cool car, but, with your SSI/SSDI disability backpay, you can potentially get those things...with your own disability money :-). I created this channel because of how many crazy things I was hearing out in the general public on how this system works. I did library seminars, academia seminars, food truck seminars (which I prefer), etc...The online video platform is the best way to reach the majority of you guys. It is weird when clients of other big box firms take pictures with me outside the hearing office...weird for the big box firms :-).

    "To make a donation, please visit: https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Nvfh3g\n\nRazoo, Why we need more interveners, and Orion's DeafBlind Intervener Internship Fund. This video is in American Sign Language, has English subtitles (open captions) and voiceover.\n\nVideo description and text:\n\nTitle on black background: Razoo and Orion\u2019s DeafBlind Intervener Internship Fund\n\nOn the bottom of the screen throughout the title is the address of the fundraiser: https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Nvfh3g\n\nThe scene opens to a shot of a white woman, hair pulled back into a ponytail, wearing a black shirt sitting in front of two visible picture frames on her light-colored stairwell wall. The photo over her left shoulder is a white framed, white matted candid head shot of a young, white-haired DeafBlind boy.  The woman starts signing in ASL. English subtitles and voiceover are present.\n\nHello. I\u2019m heather Withrow.  I\u2019m the mom of Orion Withrow. (Points to the photo of the white-haired boy.)  He is DeafBlind. He is 6 years old. We live in Texas, in the city of Austin.\n\nI was heart-touched when a person from Razoo contacted me interested in featuring Orion\u2019s intervener tuition for her practicum (internship)\nWe feel it is important to fundraise to support this field because they follow how many DeafBlind kids and adults we have.\n\nThe DeafBlind are in small numbers.\n\nFor example, in 2014, from birth to 21\u2026 We had 9,133 DeafBlind kids from birth to 21! In 2014, they counted all over USA, including Alaska and Hawaii- all over! From coast to coast.\n\nNow imagine that, with 9 thousand kids, that\u2019s all\u2026 But wait for it\u2026 Orion, in 2014, was 4 years old. He was ONE of 1,700\u2026 no, 1,709 DeafBlind kids from birth to 5 years old!  Imagine that- under two thousand DeafBlind kids 5 years old and under!\n\nWe need interveners because they are trained in depth on communication and instructional strategies for DeafBlind kids plus DeafBlind with multiple disabilities, too.\n\nWith the small number of DeafBlind kids\u2026 Even smaller are the number of people who work with them. That\u2019s why we need to grow and encourage. We need more people joining this field. The more, the merrier for our DeafBlind children and their families, too.\n\nRazoo thought [the fundraiser] was a great cause. Yay! Fine...  I\u2019m thrilled they will feature this fundraiser [this week].\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Orion, [name sign is] \u201c0-3\u201d, you can look at a Facebook page called \u201cA Mom\u2019s Musings: Orion the Kid\u201d. \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0o.t.withrow\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you want to learn about DeafBlind kids, instructional and communication options. What\u2019s already been, over time, developed in just maybe the last 50 years because DeafBlind Education itself is a very young field compared to Deaf Education which over 200 years old, I\u2019m guessing around 200 years.  Hearing education is way out there, very old.  DeafBlind Education is shorter in comparison, since the 1960\u2019s when people dove deeper and investigated this field. We know we had Helen Keller and Laura Bridgman, yes.Thanks to the two of them, DeafBlind education grew, [starting with the two of them]. We have education and more resources but that\u2019s not enough. I could go on more.\n\nSo, if you want to learn more about DeafBlind kids, look at http://www.nationaldb.org.\n\nIf you want to learn more about interveners who work with DeafBlind people, check http://www.intervener.org.\n\nThank you all for your support. Thank You.  Who benefits the most? (Mom points with her thumb to the photo of the white-haired boy behind her.) \n\nOrion (\u201c0-3\u201d) and other DeafBlind children. Thank You.\n\nThe video fades to black.\n\nCredits:\n\n\"Voiceover by Anastasia Withrow\"\n\n\"Subtitles by Heather Withrow\"\n\n\"A Withrow Family Production, MMXVI\"\n\n\"For more stories and videos, visit \nA Mom's Musings\nhexwit.blogspot.com\n&\nFacebook\nA Mom's Musings: Orion The Kid\"\n\n\"#DeafBlindKids\u201d\n\nhttps://www.razoo.com/us/story/Nvfh3g\"\n\nEnd of video.": 1,

It's simple, if you are within the law's requirements for disability benefits, you get a check every month, and health insurance. No, it doesn't include a new iPhone, house or cool car, but, with your SSI/SSDI disability backpay, you can potentially get those things...with your own disability money :-). I created this channel because of how many crazy things I was hearing out in the general public on how this system works. I did library seminars, academia seminars, food truck seminars (which I prefer), etc...The online video platform is the best way to reach the majority of you guys. \n\n#disabilitybenefits #socialsecurity #disabilityattorney #live #disabilitylaw #disabilityinformation #SSI #SSDI #RSDI #SSD\n\n|=============FREE CASE EVALUATION================|\n\nCall 407-279-1754 (my personal line\u2026if I don\u2019t pick up, leave a message and a staff member will call you back); \nor email:  wrh@disabilityresolution.com\n\n|================CONTACT LAW FIRM================|\n\nDisability Resolution, P.A.

    "Scripture Reference:  (Acts 3:1-10) \n\n\n\nWhat makes the church different from any other organization? Demonstration. \n\nWhat happens when you beg for money but walk into a miracle? That\u2019s  exactly what happened in Acts chapter 3 when Peter and John encountered the lame man at the gate called Beautiful. It was one example of how God demonstrated His power through His disciples with the help of the Holy Spirit. And God wants to continue demonstrating that same power in us today. \n\nWhen we partner with God, He enables us to change our circumstances. That way, we can always have a testimony that leads back to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus and the Truth of the gospel. So don\u2019t be surprised when miracles, signs and wonders start occurring.\n\nRemember: \u201cPublic affliction leads to public demonstration\u201d.  \n\n\n\n\nText us at (929) 203-8121 to stay connected using the following prompts: \n\"SALVATION\" \n\"PRAYER\"\n\"CONNECT\"\n\"PARTNER\" \n\n\n\nIf you'd like to support this ministry financially you can give using one of the following: \n    1.

    "In a high-stakes courtroom drama that has captivated the nation, Judge Juan Merchan is under scrutiny for allegedly collaborating with prosecutors to present evidence deemed inadmissible against former President Donald Trump. The contentious case, revolving around hush-money payments, has seen Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty pleas and David Pecker\u2019s non-prosecution agreement brought before the jury, despite questions about their relevance to Trump\u2019s guilt.\n\nAfter nearly five weeks of testimony, both the prosecution and the defense have rested, setting the stage for closing arguments on Tuesday. Once deliberations begin, the jury's decision could break historical ground, potentially making Trump the first former U.S. president with a criminal conviction and the first major party candidate to run for the White House as a felon if found guilty.\n\nThe controversy centers on Cohen\u2019s 2018 guilty pleas for Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) violations related to payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, which Cohen claimed were for non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Judge Merchan, despite ruling that Cohen\u2019s election-law convictions were not admissible as evidence of Trump\u2019s guilt, allowed prosecutors to use these convictions to challenge Cohen\u2019s credibility. This maneuver has led to accusations that the true intent was to imply Trump\u2019s involvement in these crimes.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors highlighted Pecker\u2019s non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, linked to the McDougal NDA, and American Media Inc.'s (AMI) agreement to pay a fine to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). This, too, was permitted by Judge Merchan, despite assertions that it unfairly suggested Trump\u2019s guilt by association.\n\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2 This is the high altar of the conspiratorium.

    "When the entire world turns against us, our soldiers need us more than ever.\n\nAfter seven months of fighting, the IDF\u2019s stores are depleted. They are in desperate need of more tactical gear, more supplies, more life-saving equipment - to protect our heroic soldiers and help them defeat our enemies.\n\nWe can\u2019t rely on the world's promises. We can only rely on \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd and on our brothers, Acheinu Kol Beit Yisrael.\n\nYATAR Unit: First-Line Defense Against Terror Attacks\n\nYATAR, a fully-authorized division of the IDF, is a private, specialized tactical vehicle unit \u2013 the only compact ATV unit in Israel. Founded in 2016 in the wake of the brutal murder of Dafna Meir, YATAR\u2019s mission is to protect Israel\u2019s citizens from terrorist attacks by deploying highly-trained volunteer units on Israel\u2019s borders, working alongside the IDF and border police. Their specialized ATVs can reach offroad locations quickly and be the first responders in emergencies.\n\nRight after the October 7th attack, ten of YATAR\u2019s ATVs conducted reconnaissance and combat operations in the Sderot, Nahal Oz, and Be\u2019eri regions. These ATVs have been invaluable in helping soldiers navigate dangerous roads, rubble, and tight alleys, and quickly evacuate soldiers in need of medical attention.\n\nCurrent Need\n\nAs the war in Gaza continues and tensions with Lebanon escalate, YATAR urgently needs new ATVs as well as lifesaving gear for its soldiers. Love to IDF has taken on the goal to purchase 8 new ATVs.\n\nAbout Love to IDF\n\nThe LOVE TO IDF campaign raises funds to provide essential military equipment and protective gear for our soldiers fighting in the current conflict. This initiative is under experienced leadership, ensuring each soldier gets the best equipment for the job.\n\nImpact on the Ground\n\nThe lifesaving equipment we provide not only improves the capabilities of the soldiers but serves as a powerful symbol of our support during this war. Your contribution testifies to the love and compassion our community has for the frontline soldiers.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nDonate now to support our brave soldiers. Every contribution counts.\n\nContact Information:\nLove To IDF Inc.\n5314 16 Ave. #156\nBrooklyn, NY 11204\nTax ID: 991044690\ninfo@lovetoidf.com\n(845) 373-3437\n\nThank you for taking part in our campaign.

New Jersey born, MBA, JD, Master Mason and a tireless advocate for the homeless and low income who are seeking disability benefits. It's simple, if you are within the law's requirements for disability benefits, you get a check every month, and health insurance. No, it doesn't include a new iPhone, house or cool car, but, with your SSI/SSDI disability backpay, you can potentially get those things...with your own disability money :-). I created this channel because of how many crazy things I was hearing out in the general public on how this system works. I did library seminars, academia seminars, food truck seminars (which I prefer), etc...The online video platform is the best way to reach the majority of you guys. \n\n#disabilitybenefits #socialsecurity #disabilityattorney #live #disabilitylaw #disabilityinformation #SSI #SSDI #RSDI #SSD\n\n|=============FREE CASE EVALUATION================|\n\nCall 407-279-1754 (my personal line\u2026if I don\u2019t pick up, leave a message and a staff member will call you back); \nor email:  wrh@disabilityresolution.com\n\n|================CONTACT LAW FIRM================|\n\nDisability Resolution, P.A.

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 14 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#roblox #liquate #plsdonate": 1,

    "Florida lawmakers have passed SB1718, a sweeping immigration bill aimed at penalizing undocumented migrants. Republicans control a supermajority in the Florida legislature and have touted the measure as anti-illegal immigration while Democrats consider it anti-immigrant.\n\nSome Florida pastors and evangelical groups challenged early drafts of the bill, citing religious liberty concerns. Specifically, they pointed out that the measure would make incidental transportation of people who are undocumented immigrants a third-degree felony offense.\n\nImmigrants from around the world are flooding into Florida right now and many churches have stepped up their ministries to serve these newcomers. \n\nRead the story from CBN's Heather Sells: \nhttps://www2.cbn.com/news/us/floridas-immigration-bill-amended-provide-religious-liberty-protection\n\nDownload the free CBN News App: http://cbnnews.com/app\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the CBN News Channel for more: \nhttp://youtube.com/c/CBNnewsonline/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the QuickStart Newsletter by visiting quickstart.news\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the Quickstart Podcast.

Secord Lake is located in Mid Michigan. There was much flooding that occurred around the dam at the same time that the Edenville Dam collapsed on May 19, 2020. Wixom Lake was rapidly rising due to heavy rainfall and the Edenville dam could not hold back the water. The side of the dam failed sending water rushing towards Sanford Village.

In this episode of Weathered, scientists and Native leaders tell us what we can do to reduce the harm fires can cause through design, building materials, and listening to the land. We\u2019ll even watch researchers burn a home in their lab to identify weak points and make them stronger.\n\nWeathered, produced by Portland\u2019s Balance Media, is a show about the science behind natural disasters, how they\u2019re changing, and how we can prepare.

    "#animalrescue #dogrescue #animals \nCan You Save My Pups? Mom Dog Tearfully Uses Last Breath to Beg For Help\nOn the way, the reporter said...\nA family dog was found on a highway sidewalk.\nThe trees were dense; it was difficult to see through them.\nThere they were. She was so small.\nThe tiny children were lying under her. Such a pitiful family.\nIt was quite dangerous for the rescue team to climb down, but it couldn't stop their determination.\n\n\nA few minutes later, the rescuer jumped down to approach them.\n\n\nGaining the trust of those dogs was extremely important because they could bite at any time.\nAnimal rescuers had an energy that radiated, which those dogs could feel.\n I was very surprised by that, as if they could talk to them.\nJust a few minutes later, trust was earned, and the dogs were taken to safety.\nThey named the mother dog Rita.\nRita was in an extremely difficult situation.\nHer body was weak, emaciaed, and her belly unnaturally swollen. Her fur was matted, and wounds covered her from head to paw. Walking was a struggle, especially with her hind legs barely able to support her weight. It was a heartbreaking sight.\nHow had this brave mother been left to suffer alone for so long? \n\nJoin as a member of this channel to enjoy privileges:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@petsinlove\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHello dear friend, \nPets in Love is a happy family for animal lovers.\n\nPlease Join with us by Subscribing to: https://m5.gs/ZGJFbn\nOur Channel's Goals and Mission: \n- Sharing meaningful rescue stories to improve human being with stray animals. \n- Support for Animal rescuers around the world to share their work through Youtube Videos. \n- Cooration with animal rescuer to help them getting more support, donation, followers\n\nNote: Note: We do not receipt any donation!
