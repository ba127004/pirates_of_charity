It's hard work, but together, we can make a difference. Thank you for your unwavering support! \ud83d\udc3e\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\n\nAlso a special shout out to our newest volunteer Rebecca Renmant-Oliver.\n\n#SupportUkraine #AnimalAid #DogsnHomesRescue #ThankYou #KeepHelping"

No system seems to work to protect children from the cruelty of an insane neighbor. All we can do is help these children and their parents move a bit further from the shelling, so they can sleep without the sound of explosions overhead.\n\nWe once again call on the world to help Ukraine protect its children. We ask our donors to support our projects with donations so we can continue saving lives - https://ukrainians.lu/donate/\n\nIn June, we are organizing a Ukrainian cultural festival UA Days in Luxembourg. Throughout the festival, LUkraine asbl will be raising funds for the evacuation of people from the Donetsk region.\n\nPlease come, invite your friends, and participate in our charity activities. Your support means so much to us and to these children.\n\n#InternationalChildrensDay #SupportUkraine #Charity"

No politics, no excuses, no BS. Getting shi* done with your donations asap.  When I die one of MY wishes is to change peoples views on money. Mostly my children. \n\nThis idea of getting rich to buy jewelry, nice clothes, fancy homes, exotic cars.. may that become a thing of the past. \n\nI have a confession. Doing these videos has funded HUNDREDS of exotic cars in my massive garage. My garage being my mind and soul. Each \u201cexotic car\u201d being a memory of a miracle performed by YOU guys. The coconut man getting to live in a beautiful home with his family, this video, ALL of the videos are memories and experiences that no amount of money could ever buy. The ecstasy of serving another humans need who cannot pay you back is beautiful. It is heaven on earth.\n\nI wish to inspire humans to seek wealth to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, give shelter to those in shacks, to experience REAL wealth. THAT is what money is meant for. THAT is the purpose of accumulating wealth. Not to destroy our planet for greed, or to impress mf who don\u2019t give a shi* about you.. but to better humanity, preserve our forests, rivers, and oceans, to learn to live in love before this blink of an eye life ends and we return to our real home with God above. \n\nLove you guys and want to say thank YOU for being a part of my journey on this earth\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nSpecial thanks to @locoliving_josh for bringing me to this family and helping me physically with making this video happen so quickly\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n#ecuador #murphslife #givingback #charity #compassion",

Our adoptions are down, and with no adoption fees coming in, survival without outside support is impossible.\n\nLorax\u2019s board and train will cost $3,600. We are committed to helping her become the best girl she can be and have the best chances of finding a forever home.\n\nWithout your support, we may eventually have no choice but to close our doors. Please help us help Lorax while continuing our mission to rescue and rehabilitate other dogs in need.\n\nPlease consider making a donation. No amount is too small. Your generosity can make a significant difference.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#waggingtailsdogrescueny #waggingtails #helplorax #donate #foster #adopt #volunteer #rescuedog",

            "Earlier this month a request for a bike came through from a caseworker for a former foster youth who was currently homeless. He was trying to get a job and needed a way to get around to put in applications. \n\nSomeone in the community gave money towards this need through our CarePortal platform and CityLight Vineyard Church church took the lead to make the connections and use the funds provided. \n\nThey found out that the Newark Bike Project has a free bike program for individuals who don\u2019t have another means of transportation. So today they were able to meet up there and he got a nice bike plus a helmet, lock, and lights! \n\nSince they didn\u2019t need to use the funds for the bike, they were able to then stop at the grocery store and let him shop for food with the donated funds. Just this past week he found a small place to live so was happy to be able to get groceries!\n\nTalking to the caseworker she said that the funding in state programs are so limited right now and the rules are so complicated it makes it really hard for them to get older teens the help they need. She is so grateful for orgs like ours that allow the community to jump in and help out!\n\nCheck out the Newark Bike Project if you want to buy a used bike, repair yours, or donate one! And more info on the free bike program is on their website, newarkbikeproject.org!\n\n#fostercare #formerfosteryouth #independentliving #bike #newarkbikeproject #freebike #support #donate"

            "\ud83d\udce2  Breaking News! \n\nTWO shipping containers filled with medical supplies have left Washington for Ukraine!\n\nAt iMiracleProject, we believe that medical supplies are essential for the well-being of the general population in Ukraine. We're excited to share some wonderful news with you! Thanks to the generous donation of $1 million in medical supplies from Scott's Dental and the continued donations of Donors Closet, we were able to make a significant impact. \n\nThe community came together at our Chords and Cuisine event to ship these vital supplies to Ukraine. A special thanks to Meest Washington and St John\u2019s Episcopal Church Kirkland for their support! Because of the community\u2019s support and philanthropic spirit, we were able to raise $33,000! This money went directly to the shipping of the donated supplies!\n\nWe have successfully shipped a wide range of critical items, including surgical masks, face shields, disinfectant cleaning supplies, surgical drapes, gloves, gowns, and more. These supplies will be crucial in saving hundreds of lives across Ukraine! But our work doesn't end here.\n\nThe need for medical supplies in Ukraine is relentless. Civilians continue to suffer injuries, hospitals are overwhelmed, and maternity wards are in constant operation. We cannot do this alone. We need your support to make a lasting difference. For that reason, another shipment left the warehouse TODAY on its way to help countless Ukrainians. \n\nYou can contribute to our cause in two ways:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Make an in-kind donation of supplies for our next shipment! \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If you prefer, you can also make a donation directly on our website. Every contribution, no matter the size, helps us provide essential medical supplies to those who need them most.\n\nJoin us in our mission to bring hope and healing to the people of Ukraine. Your support means the world to us!\n\n\ud83d\udc99 Make Miracles. Save Lives.

            "In immediate response to the widespread destruction caused by Cyclone Remal, Mukti has initiated a relief effort by providing tarpaulin sheets to affected families in the Sundarbans. To date, 300 tarpaulins have been distributed to the affected villagers. These tarpaulins offer immediate and essential shelter for those whose homes were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by the storm. By distributing these durable, waterproof sheets, Mukti aims to protect vulnerable families from the harsh elements, ensuring they have temporary refuge while rebuilding efforts begin. This support is vital for maintaining basic living conditions and offering a semblance of security and stability in the aftermath of the cyclone, reflecting Mukti\u2019s commitment to helping the community recover and rebuild.\n\n#CycloneRelief #Sundarbans #DisasterRecovery #CommunitySupport #Mukti #RebuildingLives #mukti #Mukti #mukti #muktisathi #UrgentNeed #donation #donationsmakeadifference #donation #donations"

            "It\u2019s my birthday!! And for my birthday this year I would like to ask for donations to AFC Basic School in Montego Bay, Jamaica. \n\nThere\u2019s a GoFundMe link here: https://gofund.me/bb406c93 and proceeds will be sent to Mrs. Dixon, the administrator. This will run for the whole month of June. \n\nOn my birthday 9 years ago, I visited this school and country for the first time. I fell in love with the kiddos and teachers there. In fact, I generally thank that trip for being the reason I became passionate about travel. I\u2019ve also been lucky enough to go back many times since.\n\nBut the school and its students need any help they can get. It\u2019s hot, the roof leaks, the playground is old and falling apart, the floors are practically dirt in some areas, the bathrooms are outside, etc. Oh, and they have to eat at their desks, because the cafeteria is literally falling apart. BUT the kids are always smiling and ready to learn. \n\nMany of the parents can hardly afford the tuition of $170 USD per year. Mrs. Dixon often ends up helping the students and paying bills for the building with her own salary\u2026 which already isn\u2019t enough. She even drives some of the students across town, so they can attend this school. \n\nThankfully, the school gets breakfast donated every day from Iberostar. With their help, we know the kids are at least eating breakfast and lunch on school days. It\u2019s so cool to see the resorts I work with doing such good things\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\n\nNow, I ask if YOU can do some good things too (if you\u2019re in the position to). Just $170 can help with a student\u2019s whole year of tuition. $60 could get them some books. Whatever you can do helps! \n\nThanks in advance, one love.\n\n#donate #gofundme #forthekids #jamaicaschools #jamaicabasicschool #happybirthdaytome #birthdayfundraiser #thankyou"

Families have lost everything and urgently need assistance.\n\n**What We Need:**\n- Generators\n- Candles, Flashlights, Batteries, Battery packs\n- Food and water, utensils, paper plates, foil, paper towels\n- Propane\n- charcoal/ charcoal grills\n- toiletries \n- adult diapers \n- Volunteers to help with clean-up and support\n\n**How You Can Help:**\n\n- Donate supplies or money\n- Volunteer your time\n- Share this post to spread the word\n\nAny donations can be dropped off at **1500 West Center Street at the Clubhouse at Fountain Plaza Apartments in Rogers**.I will be there at 10am and the rest of the day trying to help as many people as I can. \n\nA local roofing company provided a community barbecue today, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the man who brought a generator to charge people's phones. But we need more support. The Red Cross is overwhelmed, and we are in desperate need of immediate assistance. I will be setting up a go fund me tomorrow but if you want to help with money to purchase food and supplies you can send to my cash app at $DeonMonai all money will be used to help these people. \n\nPlease contact Stephanie Haynes at 501-295-9446 or deonmonai@gmail.com if you can help in any way.

            "They Just Kept Coming With Animals - 24 Feb 2024\n\nOn our last trip we were in a race against time to get animals out from all across the frontline areas in the Donbas. The big focus for us was Avdiivka, which was overrun by the Russians while we were there. But near Mar'inka, there is another small city that was in the crosshairs of the Russians, and is currently 50% occupied by the Russians. \n\nKrasnohorivka is its name.\n\nWe had just picked up a dog with Max and Ruslan from \u041f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442\u0443\u043d\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d \u0425\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0456\u0432 / Animal rescue Kharkiv, Ukraine and about to head out when one of the residents approached us and asked us to evacuate the cats they were caring for. Since the cats were so skittish and fearful of everything but their caretakers, it was decided to let them get the cats into the box. \n\nAfter we got the cats collected and into the van, another neighbor came out crying with her dog asking us to please take the dog to safety. Of course we said yes since there was still room in the van. After the recording stopped, there were even more people who came out of their homes asking us to take their animals so they could evacuate. \n\nWe still had other villages to go to so we had to draw a line sadly of how many we could take. We could have filled the van up multiple times in this area just from people wanting us to take their pets to safety so they can evacuate. We gave them the number to call and request evacuation and then had to make the very difficult decision to continue on knowing that more animals needed saved from this area. \n\nFortunately, the Russians have not moved this far into their city. But they are only a few blocks away as you can see by the map at the beginning of the video. But for these residents, they are too close for comfort and they want to get out of the area before the Russians do to their homes what they have done to so many other peaceful cities and villages in Ukraine. \n\nAll the animals were taken to Kharkiv where they were evaluated by the vets and either rehomed or held awaiting reunification with their families at a later date. \n\nThere are so many more streets like this that we have not been down yet. The amount of animals still needing help is beyond comprehension. And sadly, many people do not know that there are resources such as Global Animal Rescue And Response who will come and evacuate their pets so they can get to safety themselves. \n\nIn the meantime, we will continue to travel dangerous roads and go into harms way to help those in need in their greatest time of need. For we are Global Animal Rescue And Response and helping those in need is what we do.\n\nwww.globalanimalrescueandresponse.org\n\nGoFundMe - https://gofund.me/777c24d1 \n\nPayPal- Garrdonations@gmail.com\n\nVenmo- garrdonations\n\n#WeStandWithUkraine\n\n#Ukraine #dogs  #dog #dogsofinstagram #dogslife #dogstagram #puppy #puppies #puppiesofinstagram #puppylove  #cats #cat #kittens #kitten #catsofinstagram #animalrescue #animals #Compassion #charity #helpingothers #horses #horse  #Kherson #kharkiv #kyiv #dnipro #lviv #dogsoffacebook #sadness",

We have about 80 in care right now but will get hundreds during the spring and summer. \ud83e\udd86\nThe grand majority are mallard ducklings with a few groups of wood ducklings.

We have already had many come through our doors with shell breaks and fractures (pictured are two male painted turtles).\nThis is why we need YOU to be a hero for wildlife and do your best to be a turtle crossing guard! Turtles most often are injured while they are crossing roads. All it takes is one Good Samaritan to notice a turtle, safely stop their vehicle, and move the turtle across the road. Please make sure to move the turtle in the direction they were already facing/walking! \nWe understand in certain circumstances this isn't always possible, but we also know that so many turtles could be saved if drivers tried to be more vigilant of crossing wildlife. \nDo your part and keep an eye out for traveling turtles! \n\n#wildliferehab #wildlife #wildliferehabilitationcenter #wildliferehabilitation #westmichiganwildlifecenter #wildlifeconservation #wildliferescue #nonprofit #nonprofits #nonpprofitorganization #volunteer #volunteering #donate #donations #donation #donationsneeded #donationswelcome #michigan #michiganwildlife #grandrapids #grandrapidsmi #cuteanimals #turtlesofinstagram #reptilesofinstagram\n#turtle #turtles #paintedturtle #reptile #reptiles"

            "When interacting with people with disabilities, it's important to prioritize respect, empathy, and inclusivity. \n\nHere are some key considerations:\n\n1. Respect: Treat individuals with disabilities with the same dignity and respect as you would anyone else. They are human and they deserve it too \ud83d\udc4c \n\n2. Communication: Be mindful of communication preferences, such as speaking clearly, using simple language if needed, and asking if assistance is wanted before providing it.\n\n3. Accessibility: Ensure that physical spaces, materials, and digital content are accessible to people with various disabilities. This includes wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and screen reader compatibility.\n\n4. Avoid assumptions: Don't make assumptions about a person's abilities or limitations based on their disability. Each individual is unique and should be treated as such. \n\n5. Ask before helping: Offer assistance, but always ask first and respect their answer. Not everyone wants or needs help, and it's important to respect their autonomy.\n\n6. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to individuals with disabilities and learn from their experiences. This helps foster understanding and empathy.\n\nJibore foundation we bring out ability in disability\ud83d\udc4c Service to humanity is service to God,you can write us through jiborefoundation@gmail.com or contact us through +2348104647493 , hoping to hear from you.\n\n#jiborefoundationinilorin #jiborefoundationinnigeria #jiborefoundation #ngoinilorin #ngoinkwara #ngoinnigeria #foundationforall #NGOImpact #abilitynotdisability #equalityforall #communitydevelopment #kindnessmatters #emphatymatters #hopeforhumanity #changetheworld #actofkindness #loveandpeace #bettertogether\nOlu Glory Oluwadamilola Everyone Salami Blessing",
            "WHY YOU MUST ENGAGE IN BEGIN OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES IN GAMES.\n\n\u2705 Enhancing Accessibility and Enjoyment: \nInclusivity in gaming ensures that people living with disabilities can fully participate and enjoy games. This involves designing games that are accessible to those with various impairments, such as visual, auditory, and motor disabilities.\nFeatures like customizable controls, subtitles, and audio descriptions can make a significant difference, allowing more players to engage with the content.\n\n\u2705 Promoting Social Inclusion: \nGames are a powerful medium for social interaction. By making games accessible, developers enable people with disabilities to join their friends and family in gaming activities, fostering social bonds and reducing feelings of isolation. This inclusion extends beyond gameplay to online communities, where gamers connect, collaborate, and share experiences.\n\n\u2705 Encouraging Empathy and Understanding: \nInclusive games can serve as educational tools, raising awareness about the experiences of people with disabilities. When games include characters with disabilities or incorporate mechanics that simulate certain impairments, they can promote empathy and understanding among players who might not have firsthand experience with these challenges.\n\n\u2705 Setting Industry Standards\nWhen leading game developers prioritize inclusivity, they set new standards for the industry. This can create a ripple effect, encouraging more companies to adopt inclusive practices. Initiatives like Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller and organizations like\nAbleGamers work towards this goal, advocating for more inclusive game design and development. \n\n\u2705 Inclusivity in gaming is not just about meeting legal requirements or checking off corporate social responsibility boxes. It's about recognizing and valuing the diverse experiences of all players, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy and benefit from games.\n\nBelow is appreciation letter  from Physically challenged sport for the purchase of customised  jersey they use for competition which they were able to qualify and preparing for next match. \ud83c\udf89\n\nWe appreciate everyone who has been part of us \ud83d\ude4f and we are looking forward to having more people join us in spreading love to people living with disabilities let us always keep in mind that service  to humanity is service to God,you can write us through jiborefoundation@gmail.com or\n contact us through +2348104647493 , hoping to hear from you.\n\n#jiborefoundationinilorin #jiborefoundationinnigeria #jiborefoundation #ngoinilorin #ngoinkwara #ngoinnigeria #foundationforall #NGOImpact #abilitynotdisability #equalityforall #communitydevelopment #kindnessmatters #emphatymatters #hopeforhumanity #changetheworld #actofkindness #loveandpeace #motivation #reelsfyp\u30b7 #helpingothers #empowerment #games #gaming",

We believe this was intentional and there were cats inside that had been injured due to the fire and are in various states of medical emergency. Fire investigators have said it was arson but believe it to be the transient community so there is nobody to be held accountable.\n\nWe really need your help with funding Cinder's emergency care, stay and treatment. These funds will be used for Cinder, as well as any other cats that we catch that require emergency care.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to help, a Go Fund Me for Cinder has been set up or you can donate via e-transfer to info@hopeliveshere.com\n\nThanks so much! We\u2019d also like to say a huge thank you to the community that\u2019s been taking care of the cat colony for years.

            "NATIONAL WALKING MONTH \ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMay is National Walking Month so what better time to update you on my walking training for The North Downs 50 Ultra Challenge I am doing with my best mate @rhiluke  in July! It\u2019s a 50k (31 mile) walk and we will be raising money for @breastcancernow  \n\nThis year we\u2019ve been meeting once a month to do a long walk as part of our training. Our last walk was 10 miles in Richmond Park and we'll soon be jetting off to Croatia for a few days to get some mountain trekking in (oh the hardship!) \n\nWalking is a great way to increase your daily movement and has loads of health benefits from heart health to reducing stress & improving mood amongst other things. All forms help, from the school run to long catch up walks with your bestie, set yourself a target this month to get outside and walk more and tune in to how it makes you feel.\n\nFor anyone who would like to sponsor me for the #NorthDowns50, the link is in my bio \ud83e\udef6\n\n #friendsworkout #bestie #moodboost #charity #northdowns50 #walking #itsalongway #breastcancercharity #walkingchallenge #BreastCancer #charitywalk #breastcancernow"
