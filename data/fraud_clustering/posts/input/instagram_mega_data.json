            "Some BTS from our dopamine dressing shoot with @barnardosretail \u2728\n\nFun fact: did you know that \u201cForever yours, Betty\u201d started as a vintage side hustle? \n\nI\u2019ve been a collector of all things vintage and colourful since my teens, so by the time I hit college I ended up getting together with some like minded friends to start selling on the side at local fairs and indie shops. \n\nWe had a love for romanticising each item, creating a whole written back story of \u201cBetty\u201d. Each piece shared a snippet more about her, her life, who she was and what she was doing as well as the love and memories she had towards her entire wardrobe. We imagined her not to be selling her wares but more so sharing her stories. And so, Betty was born! \n\nIt would have been fabulous if we knew  someone called Betty wore a dress we had found while sipping a Midouri Sour with the Rocketts at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday party in 1974, but for us it was all about \u2728the fantasy\u2728 something I still automatically do with every vintage find. It may be fictional, but painting a happy exciting history just adds more fun to the whole second hand experience! \n\nBe sure to take a snap if you spot me in your local Barnados! So happy to have been asked to join such a colourful and fun bunch of creators to bring this to life!\n\n Are you a second hand romantic, or a realist?! \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc40\u2728 \n\n#dopaminedressing #secondhand #charityshop AD charity partner",

This is not depression wear from what I can see but so similar so for \u00a35 I had to have this.\nI saw this is in Age concern in Bude (close to where we were staying on holiday) I actually saw this and regretted not buying it so my dad drove me back the next day. \n\nSpaghetti Bowl and Dinner Bowls - My mum had this exact set (minus the serving bowl) when I was a child and I loved it.

Each piece shared a snippet more about her, her life, who she was and what she was doing as well as the love and memories she had towards her entire wardrobe. We imagined her not to be selling her wares but more so sharing her stories. And so, Betty was born! \n\nIt would have been fabulous if we knew  someone called Betty wore a dress we had found while sipping a Midouri Sour with the Rocketts at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday party in 1974, but for us it was all about \u2728the fantasy\u2728 something I still automatically do with every vintage find. It may be fictional, but painting a happy exciting history just adds more fun to the whole second hand experience! \n\nBe sure to take a snap if you spot me in your local Barnados!

Each piece shared a snippet more about her, her life, who she was and what she was doing as well as the love and memories she had towards her entire wardrobe. We imagined her not to be selling her wares but more so sharing her stories. And so, Betty was born! \n\nIt would have been fabulous if we knew  someone called Betty wore a dress we had found while sipping a Midouri Sour with the Rocketts at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday party in 1974, but for us it was all about \u2728the fantasy\u2728 something I still automatically do with every vintage find. It may be fictional, but painting a happy exciting history just adds more fun to the whole second hand experience! \n\nBe sure to take a snap if you spot me in your local Barnados! So happy to have been asked to join such a colourful and fun bunch of creators to bring this to life!\n\n Are you a second hand romantic, or a realist?! \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc40\u2728 \n\n#dopaminedressing #secondhand #charityshop AD charity partner",

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

Sign us up!\n\nRabbit Awareness Week is an annual campaign to educate rabbit guardians on all aspects of rabbit care. This year\u2019s theme is Neutering: Protect and Prevent.\n\nAccording to our associate @rabbitatsrescue, Canadian cities contend with abandoned pets and their feral offspring, while rural areas deal with unscrupulous breeders who routinely release their unwanted stock. It\u2019s a tragedy for the loose bunnies as they will most likely be killed by predators, parasites, sport hunters, or trappers hired for \u2018pest control.\u2019 \n\nRabbitats is working to educate new rabbit guardians on low-maintenance and sustainable care, and you can learn more about rabbit care on their page!\n\n#humanecanada #raw #rabbitats #canadianrabbits #canadianbunny\n#rabbitawareness #rabbitsofcanada #animalsupporters #animalprotection #animaladvocacy",

            "Evening you lovely people. \nIt\u2019s a bit of a different post from me tonight. \nI\u2019m sure most of you have seen or heard about the horrendous video of @kurtzouma abusing his cat. \nI made the mistake of reading the news before I went to bed last night and I was so upset and sickened that I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nIt has been on my mind all day today and I feel so sad and frustrated that I can\u2019t do anything. \nIn my opinion it is a true privilege to have a pet and the unconditional love they give us is beyond compare. \nI am so disappointed that @westham still decided to play him tonight. \nThere have been so many campaigns over the years to get abuse out of football whether it be by online trolling, racial slurs or actual physical violence in the form of throwing objects onto the pitch. But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

Each piece shared a snippet more about her, her life, who she was and what she was doing as well as the love and memories she had towards her entire wardrobe. We imagined her not to be selling her wares but more so sharing her stories. And so, Betty was born! \n\nIt would have been fabulous if we knew  someone called Betty wore a dress we had found while sipping a Midouri Sour with the Rocketts at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday party in 1974, but for us it was all about \u2728the fantasy\u2728 something I still automatically do with every vintage find. It may be fictional, but painting a happy exciting history just adds more fun to the whole second hand experience! \n\nBe sure to take a snap if you spot me in your local Barnados!

In the first few months of 2020, they came together to raise funds for Puerto Rico\u2019s earthquakes and Australia\u2019s bushfires. We are honored that they chose us to be a recipient of their efforts: \"The students and faculty from Puerto Rico at RUSVM mobilized our community soon after the disaster events, in an effort to raise funds to assist with relief efforts for animals in the affected areas.  The students decided to donate the monies to your organization, as it proves to be one that year after year continues to provide a holistic approach to improving animal welfare in Puerto Rico.\" Thank you so much to each and everyone of these students for their advocacy on behalf of the animals in Puerto Rico (and around the world) and for helping us save more lives. \n#thankyouthursday #satostrong #animaladvocates #studentsgivingback #youthactivism #vetstudents #studentschangingtheworld",

Nanti dalam form tu ada tulis.\n\nMaximum untuk life insurance + Epf ialah Rm3, 000 \nMaximum untuk medical + education insurance ialah Rm3, 000 juga.\n\nTotal Rm6,000.\n\nKalau anda bayar bulanan Rm200, setahun bayaran ialah Rm2,400. Akan ada yang boleh tuntut di bawah limit medical, dan juga di bawah limit life.\n\nKongsi kan pada rakan-rakan, supaya tiada yang terlepas pandang, dan tak tuntut pengurangan cukai ni.\n\nSemua syarikat takaful pun pasti ada statement ni ya, bukan GETB sahaja.\n\n*Yang nak copy and paste, silakan.

Anything I see can make me want to create an illustration. I love creating dresses, even sketching a dress you can make shapes and change the overall look of how it will appear on the body. I think the illusion of garments is what I totally love.\u201d\n\nKhloe founded a nonprofit organization (Khloe Kares) supporting women experiencing homelessness. She is passionate about philanthropy having raised funds to build water pumps in Ghanaian schools without access to clean water.\n\nInspired by artists who merge different eras, such as Michael Wilkinson, the costume designer for \u201cJingle Jangle,\u201d Khloe is fascinated by the fusion of Afro-Victorian styles with contemporary patterns and colors.

You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

            "To insure cleanliness Saudi banned iftar inside mosques ahead of Ramadan:\n\n#Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince, #mohammadbinsalman, issued an order banning #Iftars in #mosques ahead of Ramadan, tentatively slated to begin on March 11 and conclude by April 9 this year.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of #Islamic Affairs issued a set of instructions for mosque employees to follow during the month of Ramadan in an order dated February 20, 2024. The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

Economic status, socio-cultural beliefs and lack of sufficient menstrual awareness are contributors to the lower prevalence of women using sanitary napkins for periods. Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care of your day to day activities. A little negligence in menstrual hygiene management can cause your body grievous harm, and you may also act as an instrument for the spread of infection to others.

I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day.

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance. Any contribution means a lot to me... and I\u2019m so sorry for having to post here.\nAnd also, perhaps some of you have gone through the same ordeal and could help me with the steps to follow for treatment or share your experiences.\n\nHe has wet FIP with severe symptoms, including abdominal effusion and jaundice. He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. My other cat, Tokyo, carries the disease dormant, and we hope he remains unaffected. Praying for my bb Kaiju\u2019s recovery.\n \nYou will live.

This year\u2019s theme focuses on rabbits\u2019 environmental welfare.\n\nAccording to @rabbitatsrescue, our associates, Canadian cities contend with abandoned pets and their feral offspring while rural areas deal with unscrupulous breeders who routinely release their unwanted stock. These domestic rabbits soon become a problem for neighbourhoods forced to deal with environmentally destructive natural behaviour like chewing and burrowing.

This year\u2019s theme focuses on rabbits\u2019 environmental welfare.\n\nAccording to @rabbitatsrescue, our associates, Canadian cities contend with abandoned pets and their feral offspring while rural areas deal with unscrupulous breeders who routinely release their unwanted stock. These domestic rabbits soon become a problem for neighbourhoods forced to deal with environmentally destructive natural behaviour like chewing and burrowing. It\u2019s a tragedy for the loose bunnies as they will most likely be killed by predators, parasites, sport hunters, or trappers hired for \u2018pest control\u2019.\n\nRabbitats is dedicated to providing humane solutions to feral rabbit management by helping build affordable colony housing for sterilized rabbits and educate new rabbit guardians on low maintenance and sustainable care.\n\n#humanecanada #raw #rabbitats #canadianrabbits #canadianbunny #rabbitawareness #rabbitsofcanada #animalsupporters #animalprotection #animaladvocacy",
            "Happy 39th Anniversary to our member society @reginacatrescue! \n\nRegina Cat Rescue (RCR) devotes their work to helping abandoned cats and kittens and teaches humane education on the treatment of pets. Their mission is to sterilize and care for cats from Regina\u2019s streets, facilitate adoptions and promote responsible pet guardianship.\n\nRCR rescues cats and kittens found on the streets and provides them veterinary care such as spay/neuter surgeries, deworming, identification, vaccination and any rehabilitation necessary for adoption into loving homes. RCR also educates the public on the importance of sterilization, responsible pet care, and the benefits of well-maintained community cat colonies.\n\nCheers to the RCR Team!

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

Sign us up!\n\nRabbit Awareness Week is an annual campaign to educate rabbit guardians on all aspects of rabbit care. This year\u2019s theme is Neutering: Protect and Prevent.\n\nAccording to our associate @rabbitatsrescue, Canadian cities contend with abandoned pets and their feral offspring, while rural areas deal with unscrupulous breeders who routinely release their unwanted stock. It\u2019s a tragedy for the loose bunnies as they will most likely be killed by predators, parasites, sport hunters, or trappers hired for \u2018pest control.\u2019 \n\nRabbitats is working to educate new rabbit guardians on low-maintenance and sustainable care, and you can learn more about rabbit care on their page!\n\n#humanecanada #raw #rabbitats #canadianrabbits #canadianbunny\n#rabbitawareness #rabbitsofcanada #animalsupporters #animalprotection #animaladvocacy",

            "Evening you lovely people. \nIt\u2019s a bit of a different post from me tonight. \nI\u2019m sure most of you have seen or heard about the horrendous video of @kurtzouma abusing his cat. \nI made the mistake of reading the news before I went to bed last night and I was so upset and sickened that I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nIt has been on my mind all day today and I feel so sad and frustrated that I can\u2019t do anything. \nIn my opinion it is a true privilege to have a pet and the unconditional love they give us is beyond compare. \nI am so disappointed that @westham still decided to play him tonight. \nThere have been so many campaigns over the years to get abuse out of football whether it be by online trolling, racial slurs or actual physical violence in the form of throwing objects onto the pitch. But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

            "\ud83e\udd11 The poor are more generous than the rich when it comes to giving to good causes, according to research that challenges the \"Robin Hood\" myth of charity as an agent of redistribution.\u2060\nA study published in 2001 found that the least well-off give a higher proportion of their income to charity than the wealthy, no matter what their age, class, or beliefs.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe conclusion flies in the face of the traditional image of the most generous givers as being middle-aged, middle-class religious women living in the southeast of England. While the rich may be giving more in absolute terms, people on lower incomes are putting a higher percentage of their cash in collection boxes.\u2060\n\u2060\n_____\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udcf0 The report, titled 'The Widow's Might: How Charities Depend on The Poor,' also argued that charities are not necessarily the engines of redistribution from rich to poor that they are widely believed to be.\u2060\nMany charities - such as those supporting education or the arts - do not help the most needy, the study says. It accuses the charitable sector of giving a \"misleading\" impression of alleviating poverty in order to secure tax breaks and voluntary support.\u2060\n\u2060\n_____\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udd17 Source: Link in our bio.

            "In an act of love befitting Valentine\u2019s Day, local philanthropists @garymhess and @trevor.burgess.94 have made a $1 million gift to the @st.petersburgfreeclinic, and now they\u2019re challenging the community to match the donation.\n\nToday, the St. Petersburg Free Clinic announced the Burgess-Hess million-dollar gift and challenge that will help provide vital support for the important work of SPFC. The Free Clinic\u2019s wide-reaching work in Pinellas County provides health care, nutritious food, recovery housing, and education for our neighbors in need. With this gift, Burgess and Hess are asking locals to match the charitable support so that SPFC can continue and build upon its crucial work.\n\nAs SPFC notes, the need for support in St. Pete and Pinellas County has actually increased by more than 50% over the last few years as so many individuals and families in the area struggle to keep up with the soaring cost of living. \n\nFull story for #ilovetheburg by Bob Carskadon at the link in our bio.\n\n#stpetefreeclinic #donations #nonprofits #stpete #stpetersburg #stpetefl #stpetersburgfl #instaburg #igersstpete #tampabay #lovefl #roamfl #allthingsgood",

            "CWC Year 4 Fellow Khloe @khloe_taylor_thompson is attending CCA\u2019s pre-college program @cacollegeofarts this summer in San Francisco!\n\nSince she was just 8 years old, Khloe has been captivated by the world of fashion design. Fueled by her grandmother\u2019s exceptional sewing skills, Khloe\u2019s passion for creating clothes blossomed. \n\n\u201cAs an artist, I\u2019m inspired by anything. Anything I see can make me want to create an illustration. I love creating dresses, even sketching a dress you can make shapes and change the overall look of how it will appear on the body. I think the illusion of garments is what I totally love.\u201d\n\nKhloe founded a nonprofit organization (Khloe Kares) supporting women experiencing homelessness. She is passionate about philanthropy having raised funds to build water pumps in Ghanaian schools without access to clean water.\n\nInspired by artists who merge different eras, such as Michael Wilkinson, the costume designer for \u201cJingle Jangle,\u201d Khloe is fascinated by the fusion of Afro-Victorian styles with contemporary patterns and colors. She draws inspiration from African fashion, embracing its vibrant patterns and cultural significance.\n\u00a0\nPlease read our blog post highlighting Khloe and the other fellows attending CCA pre-college this summer.\n\nCreativeswantchange.org/blog\n\n#creativeswantchange\n#cwc\n#cca\n#ccaprecollege",

You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

            "\ud83e\udd11 The poor are more generous than the rich when it comes to giving to good causes, according to research that challenges the \"Robin Hood\" myth of charity as an agent of redistribution.\u2060\nA study published in 2001 found that the least well-off give a higher proportion of their income to charity than the wealthy, no matter what their age, class, or beliefs.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe conclusion flies in the face of the traditional image of the most generous givers as being middle-aged, middle-class religious women living in the southeast of England. While the rich may be giving more in absolute terms, people on lower incomes are putting a higher percentage of their cash in collection boxes.\u2060\n\u2060\n_____\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udcf0 The report, titled 'The Widow's Might: How Charities Depend on The Poor,' also argued that charities are not necessarily the engines of redistribution from rich to poor that they are widely believed to be.\u2060\nMany charities - such as those supporting education or the arts - do not help the most needy, the study says. It accuses the charitable sector of giving a \"misleading\" impression of alleviating poverty in order to secure tax breaks and voluntary support.\u2060\n\u2060\n_____\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udd17 Source: Link in our bio.

The Free Clinic\u2019s wide-reaching work in Pinellas County provides health care, nutritious food, recovery housing, and education for our neighbors in need. With this gift, Burgess and Hess are asking locals to match the charitable support so that SPFC can continue and build upon its crucial work.\n\nAs SPFC notes, the need for support in St. Pete and Pinellas County has actually increased by more than 50% over the last few years as so many individuals and families in the area struggle to keep up with the soaring cost of living. \n\nFull story for #ilovetheburg by Bob Carskadon at the link in our bio.\n\n#stpetefreeclinic #donations #nonprofits #stpete #stpetersburg #stpetefl #stpetersburgfl #instaburg #igersstpete #tampabay #lovefl #roamfl #allthingsgood",

            "CWC Year 4 Fellow Khloe @khloe_taylor_thompson is attending CCA\u2019s pre-college program @cacollegeofarts this summer in San Francisco!\n\nSince she was just 8 years old, Khloe has been captivated by the world of fashion design. Fueled by her grandmother\u2019s exceptional sewing skills, Khloe\u2019s passion for creating clothes blossomed. \n\n\u201cAs an artist, I\u2019m inspired by anything. Anything I see can make me want to create an illustration. I love creating dresses, even sketching a dress you can make shapes and change the overall look of how it will appear on the body. I think the illusion of garments is what I totally love.\u201d\n\nKhloe founded a nonprofit organization (Khloe Kares) supporting women experiencing homelessness. She is passionate about philanthropy having raised funds to build water pumps in Ghanaian schools without access to clean water.\n\nInspired by artists who merge different eras, such as Michael Wilkinson, the costume designer for \u201cJingle Jangle,\u201d Khloe is fascinated by the fusion of Afro-Victorian styles with contemporary patterns and colors. She draws inspiration from African fashion, embracing its vibrant patterns and cultural significance.\n\u00a0\nPlease read our blog post highlighting Khloe and the other fellows attending CCA pre-college this summer.\n\nCreativeswantchange.org/blog\n\n#creativeswantchange\n#cwc\n#cca\n#ccaprecollege",

You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

            "Evening you lovely people. \nIt\u2019s a bit of a different post from me tonight. \nI\u2019m sure most of you have seen or heard about the horrendous video of @kurtzouma abusing his cat. \nI made the mistake of reading the news before I went to bed last night and I was so upset and sickened that I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nIt has been on my mind all day today and I feel so sad and frustrated that I can\u2019t do anything. \nIn my opinion it is a true privilege to have a pet and the unconditional love they give us is beyond compare. \nI am so disappointed that @westham still decided to play him tonight. \nThere have been so many campaigns over the years to get abuse out of football whether it be by online trolling, racial slurs or actual physical violence in the form of throwing objects onto the pitch. But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

Sign us up!\n\nRabbit Awareness Week is an annual campaign to educate rabbit guardians on all aspects of rabbit care. This year\u2019s theme is Neutering: Protect and Prevent.\n\nAccording to our associate @rabbitatsrescue, Canadian cities contend with abandoned pets and their feral offspring, while rural areas deal with unscrupulous breeders who routinely release their unwanted stock. It\u2019s a tragedy for the loose bunnies as they will most likely be killed by predators, parasites, sport hunters, or trappers hired for \u2018pest control.\u2019 \n\nRabbitats is working to educate new rabbit guardians on low-maintenance and sustainable care, and you can learn more about rabbit care on their page!\n\n#humanecanada #raw #rabbitats #canadianrabbits #canadianbunny\n#rabbitawareness #rabbitsofcanada #animalsupporters #animalprotection #animaladvocacy",

            "Evening you lovely people. \nIt\u2019s a bit of a different post from me tonight. \nI\u2019m sure most of you have seen or heard about the horrendous video of @kurtzouma abusing his cat. \nI made the mistake of reading the news before I went to bed last night and I was so upset and sickened that I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nIt has been on my mind all day today and I feel so sad and frustrated that I can\u2019t do anything. \nIn my opinion it is a true privilege to have a pet and the unconditional love they give us is beyond compare. \nI am so disappointed that @westham still decided to play him tonight. \nThere have been so many campaigns over the years to get abuse out of football whether it be by online trolling, racial slurs or actual physical violence in the form of throwing objects onto the pitch. But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "To insure cleanliness Saudi banned iftar inside mosques ahead of Ramadan:\n\n#Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince, #mohammadbinsalman, issued an order banning #Iftars in #mosques ahead of Ramadan, tentatively slated to begin on March 11 and conclude by April 9 this year.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of #Islamic Affairs issued a set of instructions for mosque employees to follow during the month of Ramadan in an order dated February 20, 2024. The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

Economic status, socio-cultural beliefs and lack of sufficient menstrual awareness are contributors to the lower prevalence of women using sanitary napkins for periods. Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care of your day to day activities. A little negligence in menstrual hygiene management can cause your body grievous harm, and you may also act as an instrument for the spread of infection to others.

Hotchner, they bottled a batch and dispensed it over the 1980 Christmas season. Martha Stewart, who was then a caterer, was living in Newman's neighborhood at the time and reported a blind taste test was in favor of the dressing. \n\nNewman agreed to put his face on the bottle and call it \u201cNewman\u2019s Own\u201d \nThe Salad Dressing generated over $300,000 in first-year profits. Paul declared, \u201cLet\u2019s give it all away to those who need it!\u201d\n\nThe dressing and the foods to come, pasta sauce, frozen pizza, lemonade, fruit cocktail juices, popcorn, salsa, grape juice, and dog treats, generated profits that Newman donated 100% to charity. \n\nThe Foundation continues Paul Newman\u2019s commitment to use all the money that it receives from the sale of Newman\u2019s Own products to support children, their families, and their communities.\nMore than $600 million has been donated to thousands of organizations, helping millions of people in the U.S. and around the world.\n\n#charity #charitywork #charityfundraiser #giveback #givebacktothecommunity #saladdressing #pastasauce #salad #marthastewart #paulnewman #newmansown #foundation #westport #westportct #oilandvinegar #pizza #salsa #lemonade #lemons #lemonade\ud83c\udf4b #popcorn  #kind #connecticut",

We have also recently donated some money to 'Helping Hands' run by @christopher.furlong.79. Chris spends his time and a lot of his money helping people who are struggling sometimes to put food on the table. Getting the food together, bagging it and then delivering it to local families.

            "CWC Year 4 Fellow Khloe @khloe_taylor_thompson is attending CCA\u2019s pre-college program @cacollegeofarts this summer in San Francisco!\n\nSince she was just 8 years old, Khloe has been captivated by the world of fashion design. Fueled by her grandmother\u2019s exceptional sewing skills, Khloe\u2019s passion for creating clothes blossomed. \n\n\u201cAs an artist, I\u2019m inspired by anything. Anything I see can make me want to create an illustration. I love creating dresses, even sketching a dress you can make shapes and change the overall look of how it will appear on the body. I think the illusion of garments is what I totally love.\u201d\n\nKhloe founded a nonprofit organization (Khloe Kares) supporting women experiencing homelessness. She is passionate about philanthropy having raised funds to build water pumps in Ghanaian schools without access to clean water.\n\nInspired by artists who merge different eras, such as Michael Wilkinson, the costume designer for \u201cJingle Jangle,\u201d Khloe is fascinated by the fusion of Afro-Victorian styles with contemporary patterns and colors. She draws inspiration from African fashion, embracing its vibrant patterns and cultural significance.\n\u00a0\nPlease read our blog post highlighting Khloe and the other fellows attending CCA pre-college this summer.\n\nCreativeswantchange.org/blog\n\n#creativeswantchange\n#cwc\n#cca\n#ccaprecollege",

The @Herm\u00e8s scarf is one of the most coveted family heirloom gifts. The scarf is simple, but the patterns in the motifs are museum-quality collectibles. When most people identify luxury brands, they see them as status symbols, but Hearts4 sees them as legacy symbols. From grandmother to mother to daughter, generations and epoch themes have a vibrancy that Herm\u00e8s knows how to pull off. Just saw that this is abundantly clear to everyone. These are just conceptual ideas. The goal is to attract brands like these to work with Hearts4 and create impact campaigns. We use NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as a way to secure the authenticity of purchases and reserve the rights to own unique designs. The hope is to donate large chunks of funds to charities like the World Food Program, changing the destiny of developing countries and addressing hunger needs. Parts four in a quad centerpiece, dripping like the Enamels NFT series, and a designed repeat logo of Hs and half heart drops. All signifying the Hearts4 drop for impact with Herm\u00e8s.

Our visitors from the UK, representing St Edward's CE Primary School and Repton Primary School, recently made their first visit to Khadija Comprehensive School, Maweni Comprehensive School, and Pentrose Community School. These dedicated teachers connect their students in the UK with students in Kenya through our Global Schools Programme.\n\nThis visit marked their first time in Africa and Kenya, and it was also their first opportunity to meet the Kenyan students and teachers face-to-face. The day was filled with joyous cultural exchanges, including dances, songs, and engaging Q&A sessions. Everyone had a fantastic time sharing their experiences and learning from one another.\n\nWe are incredibly thankful for this enriching experience and eagerly anticipate sharing more photos and videos from their second day of 'School Visits'.\n\nBringing our global communities closer together! \ud83c\udf0d\u2764\ufe0f\n\n#GlobalSchools #CulturalExchange #CharityWork #EducationWithoutBorders #FirstVisit #UKtoKenya #BuildingBridges",

            "Posted @withregram \u2022 @7_plus_scripts @aiww #runforourrights  #treadmill\n\nIn defense of our freedom of press and human rights.\n\nDear Aiww.\n\nI tried really everything! 5 months now on a treadmill of life. I am tired, we are hungry, we freeze to death. We just lost our whole life. \n\nMy husband, Parisa's and Jasamin's father has been tortured and then killed because he was an interpreter, I'm not allowed to work anymore, we lost, therefore our home. I have to dress like that. Why? I'm 24. My family always told me, that I'm a pretty girl. Now I'm a faceless human. No one can see my tears anymore. Not even my daughters.\n\nWe are fearing to die like this. The silence is getting louder and louder. I want to scream! Can't cry anymore. Why, why do I have to experience this. I was never rich, but I have had a family, we have had food, we have had a smile on our faces, even when life wasn't easy for us, we were happy 5 months ago. But now, my hope is gone. Will I, will we be next! What did I do wrong? I just wanted to be a good mother, a good wife. Did I ask too much? If I did, I'm so sorry. But please, please don't forget us now. Thanks to everyone who read my words. May you all be happy and blessed in your lives. Things can change from one day to another. It can happen to all of us, I guess.\n\nYours respectfully,\nYalda Ahmadi\n\n#womensrightsarehumanrights #WomensRights #dontforgetus #helpafghanistan #charity #charitywork #afghanlivesmatterstoo #afghancharity #womenfilmmakers #womensupportingwomen #helpnow #art #artistlife #artcollector #artofinstagram #artwork #artcollection #artcollections",

You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

I am reaching out to you today with a heart full of hope and a mission to make a difference in the lives of orphaned children in Uganda, East Africa.\n\nAs someone who has experienced the pain of losing parents at a tender age, I understand the struggles and challenges that these children face every day. But I also know that with love, support, and guidance, they can overcome their circumstances and achieve their dreams.\n\nThat's why I created M&S Foundation - to provide a safe haven, education, and creative opportunities for these precious children. We are a family of 14 children, and we are determined to rise above our challenges and build a brighter future for ourselves and our community.\n\nI want to invite you to join us on this journey of hope and transformation. Your support, encouragement, and generosity can make a significant difference in our lives.

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day.

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance. Any contribution means a lot to me... and I\u2019m so sorry for having to post here.\nAnd also, perhaps some of you have gone through the same ordeal and could help me with the steps to follow for treatment or share your experiences.\n\nHe has wet FIP with severe symptoms, including abdominal effusion and jaundice. He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. My other cat, Tokyo, carries the disease dormant, and we hope he remains unaffected. Praying for my bb Kaiju\u2019s recovery.\n \nYou will live.

I\u2019m looking to raise $5,000 towards this goal. I\u2019m just a little over halfway there.

            "Like & follow @intuitivesoul_tarot__\u2764\ufe0f\n\nMystical Shaman Oracle by:\nAlberto Villoldo\nColette Baron-Reid\nMarcela Lobos\n\n\u2728The Giveaway\u2728\n\nTHE ESSENCE\nThe Giveaway is the gift you offer to life, without attachment, without expecting anything back. You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

            "To insure cleanliness Saudi banned iftar inside mosques ahead of Ramadan:\n\n#Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince, #mohammadbinsalman, issued an order banning #Iftars in #mosques ahead of Ramadan, tentatively slated to begin on March 11 and conclude by April 9 this year.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of #Islamic Affairs issued a set of instructions for mosque employees to follow during the month of Ramadan in an order dated February 20, 2024. The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

Economic status, socio-cultural beliefs and lack of sufficient menstrual awareness are contributors to the lower prevalence of women using sanitary napkins for periods. Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care of your day to day activities. A little negligence in menstrual hygiene management can cause your body grievous harm, and you may also act as an instrument for the spread of infection to others.

            "One of my recent Fail and Rise moments was realizing that to be able to care for others, I must also learn to take care of myself. We often hear, \u2018what you put in, is what you can expect to get out.\u2019 That is true when it comes to your own thoughts, emotions, and self-care. You can only give others what you give yourself - so be positive and love yourself!

The Free Clinic\u2019s wide-reaching work in Pinellas County provides health care, nutritious food, recovery housing, and education for our neighbors in need. With this gift, Burgess and Hess are asking locals to match the charitable support so that SPFC can continue and build upon its crucial work.\n\nAs SPFC notes, the need for support in St. Pete and Pinellas County has actually increased by more than 50% over the last few years as so many individuals and families in the area struggle to keep up with the soaring cost of living. \n\nFull story for #ilovetheburg by Bob Carskadon at the link in our bio.\n\n#stpetefreeclinic #donations #nonprofits #stpete #stpetersburg #stpetefl #stpetersburgfl #instaburg #igersstpete #tampabay #lovefl #roamfl #allthingsgood",

I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day.

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

            "Today, I come with sad news. My heart is shattered as I share that my baby has been diagnosed positive for FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis). I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance. Any contribution means a lot to me... and I\u2019m so sorry for having to post here.\nAnd also, perhaps some of you have gone through the same ordeal and could help me with the steps to follow for treatment or share your experiences.\n\nHe has wet FIP with severe symptoms, including abdominal effusion and jaundice. He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. My other cat, Tokyo, carries the disease dormant, and we hope he remains unaffected. Praying for my bb Kaiju\u2019s recovery.\n \nYou will live.

            "Like & follow @intuitivesoul_tarot__\u2764\ufe0f\n\nMystical Shaman Oracle by:\nAlberto Villoldo\nColette Baron-Reid\nMarcela Lobos\n\n\u2728The Giveaway\u2728\n\nTHE ESSENCE\nThe Giveaway is the gift you offer to life, without attachment, without expecting anything back. You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

            "To insure cleanliness Saudi banned iftar inside mosques ahead of Ramadan:\n\n#Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince, #mohammadbinsalman, issued an order banning #Iftars in #mosques ahead of Ramadan, tentatively slated to begin on March 11 and conclude by April 9 this year.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of #Islamic Affairs issued a set of instructions for mosque employees to follow during the month of Ramadan in an order dated February 20, 2024. The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

Economic status, socio-cultural beliefs and lack of sufficient menstrual awareness are contributors to the lower prevalence of women using sanitary napkins for periods. Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care of your day to day activities. A little negligence in menstrual hygiene management can cause your body grievous harm, and you may also act as an instrument for the spread of infection to others.

Remember a flower cannot bloom without love, a few tears, some sweat, and getting a little dirty! \n\nNational Imperial Miss\n\n#leadandlove #community #communityservicematters #communityservicedriven #communityservice #leadersserve #donationsmatter #donationsmakeadifference #donations #imperialstrong #BeImperial #jrteen #NIM #ImperialStrong #failandrise #beimperial #NIMPeachStateJrTeen24 #georgiagirl #georgia #Georgia #pageantlovers #beautyandbrains #pageantry #pageantqueen #peachstate #pagentgirl #pageantlife #mentalwellnessmatters #mentalhealthawareness #mindyourkindness",

The Free Clinic\u2019s wide-reaching work in Pinellas County provides health care, nutritious food, recovery housing, and education for our neighbors in need. With this gift, Burgess and Hess are asking locals to match the charitable support so that SPFC can continue and build upon its crucial work.\n\nAs SPFC notes, the need for support in St. Pete and Pinellas County has actually increased by more than 50% over the last few years as so many individuals and families in the area struggle to keep up with the soaring cost of living. \n\nFull story for #ilovetheburg by Bob Carskadon at the link in our bio.\n\n#stpetefreeclinic #donations #nonprofits #stpete #stpetersburg #stpetefl #stpetersburgfl #instaburg #igersstpete #tampabay #lovefl #roamfl #allthingsgood",

Because of you Thistle I started another career helping animals, and I think of this often. Thank you for our short time together and for propelling me into a field I love. Hopefully in the future there will be successful treatments for FIP, its a devastating diagnosis and agonizing to go through.

I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day.

She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

            "Today, I come with sad news. My heart is shattered as I share that my baby has been diagnosed positive for FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis). I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance. Any contribution means a lot to me... and I\u2019m so sorry for having to post here.\nAnd also, perhaps some of you have gone through the same ordeal and could help me with the steps to follow for treatment or share your experiences.\n\nHe has wet FIP with severe symptoms, including abdominal effusion and jaundice. He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. My other cat, Tokyo, carries the disease dormant, and we hope he remains unaffected. Praying for my bb Kaiju\u2019s recovery.\n \nYou will live.

You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity.

            "To insure cleanliness Saudi banned iftar inside mosques ahead of Ramadan:\n\n#Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince, #mohammadbinsalman, issued an order banning #Iftars in #mosques ahead of Ramadan, tentatively slated to begin on March 11 and conclude by April 9 this year.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of #Islamic Affairs issued a set of instructions for mosque employees to follow during the month of Ramadan in an order dated February 20, 2024. The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

Economic status, socio-cultural beliefs and lack of sufficient menstrual awareness are contributors to the lower prevalence of women using sanitary napkins for periods. Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care of your day to day activities. A little negligence in menstrual hygiene management can cause your body grievous harm, and you may also act as an instrument for the spread of infection to others.

            "To insure cleanliness Saudi banned iftar inside mosques ahead of Ramadan:\n\n#Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince, #mohammadbinsalman, issued an order banning #Iftars in #mosques ahead of Ramadan, tentatively slated to begin on March 11 and conclude by April 9 this year.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of #Islamic Affairs issued a set of instructions for mosque employees to follow during the month of Ramadan in an order dated February 20, 2024. The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care of your day to day activities. A little negligence in menstrual hygiene management can cause your body grievous harm, and you may also act as an instrument for the spread of infection to others.

However, Sam also has a rare condition called Tethered Cord, where the spinal cord (which should float free) becomes attached in the lumbar spine, causing global symptoms. These include, but are not limited to, severe leg weakness, muscle pulling, bladder issues and neck instability. This condition is much more common in people with #symptomatichypermobility and #EDS\n \nSam has been unwell for quite some time now. Up until a few years ago her symptoms were manageable and she was functional, but they got worse.\n \nIn November 2023, Sam had an initial operation in the UK with a spinal surgeon which brought lots of improvements. Unfortunately, after a few months Sam's symptoms returned, most likely due to scar tissue, or inflammation that wasn't properly controlled after the surgery.\n\nSam now desperately needs to get to Barcelona's #TeknonMedicalCentre or #RhodeIslandHospital in the US to access an operation with experts in this very niche area.\n\nFinances for Sam and her family have grown increasingly difficult - the NHS doesn\u2019t do the operation, and whilst she managed to get health insurance to pay for 50% of the first operation, it won\u2019t cover further surgery.\n\nThe actual cost is around \u00a340k, so we're doing our best to raise a decent proportion of this amount. If we can raise more than our target, that would be fantastic.\n\nWe know that asking people for money is Sam's worst nightmare (other than not being able to move from her bed), so we are doing this on her behalf. \n\nBefore she became ill, Sam was a freelance writer and music nerd - a life that she would very much like to get back to!\n\nThe photo shown is from several years ago, visiting the National History Museum with Zach - Sam's favourite small person.\n\nWe're grateful for whatever you're able to contribute. Or, if you can't but know someone who might, please #share this. Thank you! :)\n\n#sedsconnective #bendybodies #EDS #hypermobility #tetheredcord #tetheredcordsyndrome",

Today, we are asking for your help, as Osny is currently fighting for his life.\u00a0\n\nIn 2020, Osny, along with the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice (@ic4ij) and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (@chirla_org) filed a federal lawsuit against ICE, challenging the agency\u2019s use of deception in order to enter immigrants\u2019 homes. Despite the risk of retaliation, Osny stood on principle, and he stood up not only for himself but the thousands of immigrants just like him who are vulnerable to deceptive ICE tactics and abuse.\u00a0\n\nRecently, Osny was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease, one that landed him in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit,\u00a0 where he has remained for the past four weeks. This disease has left Osny debilitated, with loss of mobility in his arms and legs, and no ability to financially provide for his family. Even when released from the hospital, Osny will require extensive rehabilitative care, and he will not be able to return to work for the remainder of the year.\u00a0\n\nPlease consider standing in solidarity with Osny, and supporting this fundraising campaign. We cannot rely on the government to care for our community\u2019s health and well-being; we must be a community that protects itself, and especially for people like Osny, who has fought to protect the community, taking on one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the world-- because it was the right thing to do, because it had to be done.\u00a0\n\nEvery contribution counts; please give what you can, and keep Osny and his family in your good thoughts.

Since opening in 2021, the shop has become a cornerstone of our neighbourhood, not just for its breadth of choice and quality of produce, but for something far more special\u2014 the owner, Patsy.\n\nPatsy owns and operates the shop entirely on her own after losing her job as a housing officer in 2013. She\u2019s always in the shop, welcoming customers with a warm smile and a friendly conversation. For many of us, Patsy is more than just the local grocer\u2014 she\u2019s a recipe sharer, a source of culinary advice, an importer not just of vegetables, but of knowledge and care.\n\nOn May 29th, Patsy\u2019s shop was violently broken into, the front window smashed and the till stolen. This is the second time the shop has been broken into this year, and the costs of continuously having to repair the shop and the loss of income when the shop is closed have become crippling for an independent shop like Patsy\u2019s.\n\nSo we\u2019ve decided to set up a fundraiser on her behalf! We need to raise \u00a33000 in total, breakdown below:\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Till replacement: \u00a3500 \n\ud83e\ude9f Window repair: \u00a3350 \n\ud83d\udcc9 Loss of income: \u00a3120 \n\ud83d\udcb8 Petty cash stolen: \u00a330 \n\ud83d\udd12 Electronic window shutter: \u00a31300 \n\ud83d\udcf9 CCTV replacement: \u00a3700 \n\nWith your support, we can help Patsy replace what was stolen, secure her shop with new shutters and CCTV, and ensure she can continue serving our community safely and securely.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f Please donate generously and help us secure the future of this wonderful corner of Ladywell. Every little bit helps!\n\n\ud83d\udd17 www.gofundme.com/f/ladywell-village-fruit-and-veg-recovery-fund\n\nThank you for your support!\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Patsy\u2019s Friends and Neighbours\n\n#SupportLocal #Ladywell #Lewisham #CommunityLove #SmallBusiness #GoFundMe #Fruit #Vegetables",

Their current circumstances are extremely dire as they have been constantly displaced while enduring bombing, sniping, and forced starvation. Please help them by donating to their links in my bio or on their pages (if you get a warning on the GFM, please ignore it. We have been in touch with them daily for months now. They are our friends.) and sharing widely. The border crossing may be closed now, but once it opens, they need to be ready to go. They also need to purchase basic necessities, in the meantime. If everyone who saw this donated 10\u00a3, they would meet their goals in no time. Help save a family; it\u2019s one of the most beautiful things you can do.

She stepped on something sharp, resulting in a clean cut that required immediate surgery. The total cost of the surgery is 700 euros, an amount that I simply cannot afford as an intern living on a scholarship.\n\nSonechko means the world to me. She\u2019s been my loyal companion through thick and thin, always there to bring a smile to my face. Seeing her in pain breaks my heart, and I am doing everything I can to ensure she gets the care she needs.\n\nI am asking for your help to cover the cost of her surgery and post-operative care.

            "Today is the last day of both EDS and Mental Health Awareness Months. For me, they go hand in hand. Let me preface this by saying I know many hold the beliefs that it always be worse, & that positivity is the only way. For me, the first is stating the obvious, & as for the second one, I disagree as there are a plethora of emotions we should be feeling.\n\nThis is something I\u2019ve been hesitant to talk about as it\u2019s such a complex subject for me, but this surgery seems to have given me back my ability to eat many foods I could not previously eat without throwing up. If you know me well you know in 2022 I lost 50lbs because I couldn\u2019t eat. We were at the point of discussing a feeding tube. I put myself in thousands of $ of debt trying every GI test, but found nothing. I gave up, I ate nothing but bland or pur\u00e9ed food. There were times I wanted to die.\n\nFast forward when I met my thoracic (slipping rib) surgeon. He asked very specific GI questions. I answered, he told me the obvious. EDS patients have GI issues, often severe but sometimes not caused by the GI tract itself. I already knew about vascular compressions he told me about (I looked into them years prior but was too broke to pursue it). He told me *SOMETIMES* when the ribs are crushing certain intercostal nerves, it can cause them to send the wrong signals to the GI tract. I heard him but went into surgery not considering my GI issues may be fixed. \n\nI\u2019m slowly reintroducing foods I haven\u2019t eaten in years. I haven\u2019t felt the need to throw up once. I am thrilled, heartbroken and absolutely furious. \n\nI live in a body that plays tricks on me. I am surrounded by doctors who don\u2019t know how my body works & stuck in a healthcare system that does not care if I live or die. \n\nAll this for just one of my issues.\n\nMy final words on EDS & Mental Health are that both are extremely complex. Both the general public and the healthcare industry need to take the time to better understand them.\n\n#ehlersdanlossyndrome #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #surgeryrecovery #heds #gofundme #chronicillness #dysautonomia #pots #slippedribsyndrome #ehlerdanlosawareness #chronicpain #healthcareindustry #edsawarenessmonth",

Can you imagine this? Since then, the family has been displaced numerous times, including very recently when the occupation forces began their ground invasion of Rafah.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a copy of this hand-printed card, donate\u00a0\u20ac15 or more to their\u00a0campaign, DM @marinazart with a screenshot of your donation receipt & postal address.\n\nOr donate \u20ac10 to go into the raffle to win an original artwork by the talented Brazilian-Finnish artist @lucianamariano\n\nDonate to:\nwww.gofundme.com/my-kids-are-looking-to-drink-water-daily\nLink in bio.

It\u2019s hard to know with the endless pain we see.\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\n\nYesterday, we went with Prince to the vet after what is now 3 horrible weeks of vets, examinations, CT scan, antibiotics, sleepless nights, being in pain, not being able to walk, and just one hour later, we had another emergency with Abi where she is drowsy and falling down\ud83d\ude31 Not a day goes by that we don\u2019t have at least 5 unexpected problems.\u2757\n\nAt this moment, we have Puki in Kennels, which is \u00a3450 due today\ud83d\udea8 Sharka and Cairo unexpectedly need to leave their homes, and we can\u2019t even predict the costs, A FOOD BILL paid in half that we wont be able able to make a new order, a VET debt that just keeps getting bigger, Abi, Sammi, Buster and Lucky waiting for their boosters and POOR BABY BADA will need another check up to a specialist before they decide on surgery\ud83d\ude14 \n\nThe dog food for our 36 animals is \u00a3800, the vet is \u00a31600, Puki \u00a3450, Bada\u2019s transportation to the vet in Bitola is \u00a390, the pharmacy cost us at least \u00a380 a month, gasoline for the generator is \u00a3120 and since all of this work is IMPOSSIBLE with just 2 people and no volunteers, we have to pay workers \u00a3690 a month\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude4f\n\nWe hope what we do is good. But with just a few people doing everything: the rescuing, the cleaning, social media, driving, vet visits, socializing, everything that you see, and everything that we have no time to post\u2026there is constant stress and confusion. It\u2019s hard to look at the big picture when you are stuck in a million problems every day, a million information about the pills, the wounds, the food, the vaccines, the long waiting for adoption, the problems with the adopted dogs in UK, fears about their safety, fears about their future\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udea8 \n\nHow you can help us:\n\n\ud83e\udea7Monzo Bank - Elaine NIXEY\nSort code 04-00-03\nAccount number 21228772\n\ud83e\udea7Donations by card: \nhttps://naladogrescue.org/donate/\n\ud83e\udea7PayPal:\nhttp://paypal.me/nalarescueuk",

The one they says \u201cDonate\u201d will take you to a page where you can either choose to make a one time donation, or a reoccurring monthly one. These options allow you to now be able to donate directly from your card/bank account. We know that some aren\u2019t comfortable using apps like venmo and cashapp, so we wanted to provide a more accessible option. \n\nIf you hit the \u201cDedicated Donations tab\u201d , you are able to dedicate a donation to a specific animal, person, situation, etc. Each name listed represents a heartfelt tribute and a generous act that helps us provide care and a loving home for dogs in need. We wanted to add a sentimental / interactive aspect to donations, to better connect with the community and allow everyone to spotlight an animal/person/ situation that impacted them.\n\nWe want to thank everyone that supports us every day in our mission of saving lives.

It marks a pivotal moment in my transition, one that I\u2019ve openly shared since 2018 to offer insight and support, particularly in South Africa where resources and representation are scarce.

Your support, whether through donations or sharing, will bring me closer to realizing this dream. \n\nLINK IN BIO \n\nTop surgery isn\u2019t just about physical changes; it\u2019s about reclaiming my comfort and confidence in my own skin. It\u2019s about feeling whole and authentic in every aspect of my being. If you\u2019re curious to learn more about my journey, I\u2019ve poured my heart out in a detailed story on the fundraising page.\n\nLINK IN BIO \n\nYour contribution, big or small, is invaluable and deeply appreciated. If donating isn\u2019t feasible for you, simply spreading the word within your networks can make a world of difference.\n\nLINK IN BIO \n\nAnd to my fellow queer community, my DMs are always open.

You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

            "I was dating & living with Sam aka HowieRoll, aka Scott Byers, aka Rob Thick, after getting out of a bad situation in North Carolina. Things were good for the first couple of weeks or so. Then things slowly went downhill. \n\nThursday, I had to get my Honda towed to the house where Sam & I were living because I got a flat tire on the way to do food delivery. My Honda at the time was loaded down with all my belongings in it. I'm not even sure if I can get to it or if the platform bed shifted to where I can't get to it. \n\nI moved out late Thursday 5/23/24 into early Friday 5/24/25 morning after he accused me of having a man in his room. Unfortunately I had to leave my Honda at the house.\n\nI was gone for 1.5 days, and in that time, someone smashed in my radiator and everything in that area. I found out about this when I tried to pick up my Honda on Saturday 5/25/24 when I thought it was just the tire. Coincidence, I think \ud83e\udd14 not. \n\nThere are videos posted to YouTube from Thursday with the flat tire to the break up to teying to pick up my Honda on Saturday to Tuesday when i finally was able to move my Honda to a safe location.\n\nFlat Tire Video \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/Gi09On34q6c?si=rC4qPWfMuc8PRrTU\n\nBreak up video \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://youtu.be/a6p5K-23GPw?si=k78DUp2iD9O5GD3D\n\nSaturday 5/25/24 \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://youtu.be/9oqEWlPRA64?si=_cc0gjtnUreET-2r\n\nTuesday 5/28/24 \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://youtu.be/mXlzB0Dmb1w?si=UDVuPdB3mf4xm7wK\n\nPolice & State troopers won't do anything because I have no proof. I only have liability insurance. I've not been able to find employment outside of food delivery because I've moved around a lot. \n\nI got my Honda off the property I lived at with Sam on Tuesday 5/28/24 with the donations from a friend. The Honda has no new damage from Saturday to Tuesday. I had it towed to the property my friend is letting me stay at. \n\nWith donations I'll be able to pay my cellphone bill, see if I can find a mobile mechanic to come out and look at my Honda. Buy 3 used tires & make repairs on my Honda. \n\nI'm currently staying with a friend, but have no means of transportation other than using rideshare as there are no transit system out here. \n\nhttps://gofund.me/0083b51f\n#GoFundMe",

After exchanging some words we started talking suffering from schizophrenia and abandonment and other issues. I had my luggage I gave him my pants and I gave him a T-shirt so we could feel more humanized. The question he asked is why did you help? I was like we're all humans we all need help. For some reason my photography draws me to people that need help. Who do you work for what agency. No one this is just the kindness of my heart. I let him use my phone he called his mom he hasn't talked to in 7 years, I was late for something but his mother come and pick him up and I truly wish everything but the best for this gentleman.

Each piece shared a snippet more about her, her life, who she was and what she was doing as well as the love and memories she had towards her entire wardrobe. We imagined her not to be selling her wares but more so sharing her stories. And so, Betty was born! \n\nIt would have been fabulous if we knew  someone called Betty wore a dress we had found while sipping a Midouri Sour with the Rocketts at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday party in 1974, but for us it was all about \u2728the fantasy\u2728 something I still automatically do with every vintage find. It may be fictional, but painting a happy exciting history just adds more fun to the whole second hand experience! \n\nBe sure to take a snap if you spot me in your local Barnados! So happy to have been asked to join such a colourful and fun bunch of creators to bring this to life!\n\n Are you a second hand romantic, or a realist?! \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc40\u2728 \n\n#dopaminedressing #secondhand #charityshop AD charity partner",

            "Today is one year since my baby Thistle passed. Rest in peace sweet Thistle. I have not posted on here but I have also been working as a vet tech. Because of you Thistle I started another career helping animals, and I think of this often. Thank you for our short time together and for propelling me into a field I love. Hopefully in the future there will be successful treatments for FIP, its a devastating diagnosis and agonizing to go through. I donated again to The Winn Feline Foundation who funds a bunch of FIP research. Love you little Thistle \u2764\ufe0f #fuckfip #felineinfectiousperitonitisawareness  #felineinfectiousperitonitis #winnfelinefoundation #fipresearch #endfip",
            "It\u2019s Lacy\u2019s 3 year cure date from FIP. I\u2019m grateful everyday that I have this silly, sassy, snuggle bug in my life. I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day. Please check out @zenbycat and think about becoming a monthly donor to help with the research \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e #fipsucks #fipsurvivor #curedoffip #formerferal #fipwarrior #fipresearch #rescuecat",

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance.

He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. My other cat, Tokyo, carries the disease dormant, and we hope he remains unaffected. Praying for my bb Kaiju\u2019s recovery.\n \nYou will live.

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "When still only a small baby, he travelled from his home town to a distant place... It was not a pleasant trip, in particular because his mother wasn\u2019t with  him. The journey ended at a new home: a building with many windows and strange people. Inside, he joined his new brothers and sisters and a different sort of life began for him. That day, he was just 14 weeks old. Ten months later he was confirmed as being HIV-positive. \n\nChildren born to HIV-positive mothers have a much higher risk than others of being abandoned at or soon after birth.

            "To insure cleanliness Saudi banned iftar inside mosques ahead of Ramadan:\n\n#Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince, #mohammadbinsalman, issued an order banning #Iftars in #mosques ahead of Ramadan, tentatively slated to begin on March 11 and conclude by April 9 this year.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of #Islamic Affairs issued a set of instructions for mosque employees to follow during the month of Ramadan in an order dated February 20, 2024. The Ministry also issued orders restricting imams and muezzins from collecting financial #donations for organising iftar feasts. The Islamic Affairs Ministry of Saudi Arabia also imposed a ban on organising iftar feasts inside the mosques, raising concerns regarding cleanliness.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), the caption to the notice read, \u201cThe #Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs, Dawah and Guidance issues a number of instructions related to mosques during the blessed month of #Ramadan 1445 AH.\u201d\n\nThe order stated, \u201cImams and muezzins in various regions of the Kingdom not to collect financial donations for Iftar projects for fasting people and others.\u201d\n\nThe notice, raising issues about #cleanliness being compromised when iftar feasts are held inside mosques, directed imam and muezzin to oversee the organisation of these feasts in mosques\u2019 courtyards and charged them with the responsibility to ensure cleanliness soon after the feast concludes.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notice stated, \u201cIftar projects should not be held inside mosques due to concerns about cleanliness, so an appropriate place should be prepared in the mosques\u2019 courtyards without the use of temporary rooms, tents, or the like, and that Iftar should be under the imam\u2019s and muezzin\u2019s responsibility, with the obligation of the one who breaks the fast to clean the place immediately after finishing food.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Ministry discouraged using cameras inside the mosque premises, stating that they should not be used to record the imam and worshippers offering namaz, as this undermines worshippers\u2019 reverence. The Ministry also issued orders that prayers should not be broadcast on media of any kind, including social media.\n\n#aurangabadtimes",

Taking care of yourself during menstruation is as important as taking care of your day to day activities.

            "\ud83e\udd11 The poor are more generous than the rich when it comes to giving to good causes, according to research that challenges the \"Robin Hood\" myth of charity as an agent of redistribution.\u2060\nA study published in 2001 found that the least well-off give a higher proportion of their income to charity than the wealthy, no matter what their age, class, or beliefs.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe conclusion flies in the face of the traditional image of the most generous givers as being middle-aged, middle-class religious women living in the southeast of England. While the rich may be giving more in absolute terms, people on lower incomes are putting a higher percentage of their cash in collection boxes.\u2060\n\u2060\n_____\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udcf0 The report, titled 'The Widow's Might: How Charities Depend on The Poor,' also argued that charities are not necessarily the engines of redistribution from rich to poor that they are widely believed to be.\u2060\nMany charities - such as those supporting education or the arts - do not help the most needy, the study says. It accuses the charitable sector of giving a \"misleading\" impression of alleviating poverty in order to secure tax breaks and voluntary support.\u2060\n\u2060\n_____\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udd17 Source: Link in our bio.

The Free Clinic\u2019s wide-reaching work in Pinellas County provides health care, nutritious food, recovery housing, and education for our neighbors in need. With this gift, Burgess and Hess are asking locals to match the charitable support so that SPFC can continue and build upon its crucial work.\n\nAs SPFC notes, the need for support in St. Pete and Pinellas County has actually increased by more than 50% over the last few years as so many individuals and families in the area struggle to keep up with the soaring cost of living. \n\nFull story for #ilovetheburg by Bob Carskadon at the link in our bio.\n\n#stpetefreeclinic #donations #nonprofits #stpete #stpetersburg #stpetefl #stpetersburgfl #instaburg #igersstpete #tampabay #lovefl #roamfl #allthingsgood",

            "CWC Year 4 Fellow Khloe @khloe_taylor_thompson is attending CCA\u2019s pre-college program @cacollegeofarts this summer in San Francisco!\n\nSince she was just 8 years old, Khloe has been captivated by the world of fashion design. Fueled by her grandmother\u2019s exceptional sewing skills, Khloe\u2019s passion for creating clothes blossomed. \n\n\u201cAs an artist, I\u2019m inspired by anything. Anything I see can make me want to create an illustration. I love creating dresses, even sketching a dress you can make shapes and change the overall look of how it will appear on the body. I think the illusion of garments is what I totally love.\u201d\n\nKhloe founded a nonprofit organization (Khloe Kares) supporting women experiencing homelessness. She is passionate about philanthropy having raised funds to build water pumps in Ghanaian schools without access to clean water.\n\nInspired by artists who merge different eras, such as Michael Wilkinson, the costume designer for \u201cJingle Jangle,\u201d Khloe is fascinated by the fusion of Afro-Victorian styles with contemporary patterns and colors. She draws inspiration from African fashion, embracing its vibrant patterns and cultural significance.\n\u00a0\nPlease read our blog post highlighting Khloe and the other fellows attending CCA pre-college this summer.\n\nCreativeswantchange.org/blog\n\n#creativeswantchange\n#cwc\n#cca\n#ccaprecollege",

Commissions are open aswell if you\u2019d like to comment or dm me for inquiries.\n\nToday and recently has been very hard on us, especially for money, and life situations \nOne situation in particular is my sister\u2019s chameleon Pickle, becoming suddenly Egg-Bound (I think that\u2019s the term for our situation) \n\nPickle\u2019s leg has become swollen aswell, we assume from her current situation. \nShe has a lay bin and proper husbandry. We have been providing her calcium dusted crickets at appropriate times (feeding times) and even have tried to give her extra water because she needs to stay hydrated and seems to be too weak right now to get to her water dish.\n\nWe NEED help. \nSpecifically help TO SAVE HER LIFE.\n\nPickle is in desperate need of help from a vet. Which we would have been able to afford before the bills came up and my water heater broke in the house AND my moms tire completely flattened on her car (had to buy new tire) aswell as my mom\u2019s car radiator breaking or whatever too so ermmmm\n\nThank you so much for taking your time to read this.

Inilah kisah luar biasa Adit Prayoga, pendiri Rumah Makan Gratis di Ciangsana, Bogor.\n\nAdit Prayoga memulai dengan hanya menyediakan 20 porsi makanan gratis setiap hari. Namun sekarang, ribuan porsi makanan bisa dibagikan setiap harinya kepada mereka yang membutuhkan. Dalam keterbatasan ekonomi, Adit tak pernah berhenti berbagi.\n\nKini, Adit telah memiliki enam Rumah Makan Gratis yang tersebar di wilayah Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, dan Jakarta. Menggunakan uang pribadinya, Adit dan istrinya menghadirkan kebaikan dalam hidup warga sekitar.\n\nKisah yang begitu menginspirasi ya, Sahabat.

            "Like & follow @intuitivesoul_tarot__\u2764\ufe0f\n\nMystical Shaman Oracle by:\nAlberto Villoldo\nColette Baron-Reid\nMarcela Lobos\n\n\u2728The Giveaway\u2728\n\nTHE ESSENCE\nThe Giveaway is the gift you offer to life, without attachment, without expecting anything back. You can only give what is truly yours: a smile, a nod of encouragement, a gentle touch, and a kind word. This is not giving to others what you no longer want, like the sweater that no longer fits, but gifting that which is most precious-your authentic love and genuine feelings.\n\nTHE INVITATION\nMake a list of 10 people and things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude. The giveaway comes to ask you to feel the same gratitude without needing anything or anyone to inspire it, and to share this gratitude with those you meet.\n\nAs you offer thanks, your heart opens and you start realizing how much life has given you. You heal your feelings of scarcity and open yourself to the abundance that surrounds you. The giveaway invites you to be in the flow of life, as you give freely and receive freely.\n\nTHE MEDICINE\nIs it difficult for you to set limits on how much of yourself you give? If you give more than is healthy, then you will not be able to give for long.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel resentful with your partner or associates, or you\u2019ll feel like the world owes you something in return.\nNotice if you give for any reason other than pure generosity. Are you trying to be liked or accepted? Are you hoping to heal an old wound?\n\nStart giving to yourself first and foremost. Offer yourself the care, the love, the time, and the acceptance that you are longing for. Once you experience plenty, then you can truly give to others.\n\n#tarot #oraclecardreading #generosity #kindness #love #charity #donate #community #gratitude #compassion #generous #nonprofit #donations #giving #help #helpingothers #fundraising #giveback #hope #motivation #payitforward #bekind #givingback #thankyou #family #grateful #inspiration #support  #elevate #energy",

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

Sign us up!\n\nRabbit Awareness Week is an annual campaign to educate rabbit guardians on all aspects of rabbit care. This year\u2019s theme is Neutering: Protect and Prevent.\n\nAccording to our associate @rabbitatsrescue, Canadian cities contend with abandoned pets and their feral offspring, while rural areas deal with unscrupulous breeders who routinely release their unwanted stock. It\u2019s a tragedy for the loose bunnies as they will most likely be killed by predators, parasites, sport hunters, or trappers hired for \u2018pest control.\u2019 \n\nRabbitats is working to educate new rabbit guardians on low-maintenance and sustainable care, and you can learn more about rabbit care on their page!\n\n#humanecanada #raw #rabbitats #canadianrabbits #canadianbunny\n#rabbitawareness #rabbitsofcanada #animalsupporters #animalprotection #animaladvocacy",

            "Evening you lovely people. \nIt\u2019s a bit of a different post from me tonight. \nI\u2019m sure most of you have seen or heard about the horrendous video of @kurtzouma abusing his cat. \nI made the mistake of reading the news before I went to bed last night and I was so upset and sickened that I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nIt has been on my mind all day today and I feel so sad and frustrated that I can\u2019t do anything. \nIn my opinion it is a true privilege to have a pet and the unconditional love they give us is beyond compare. \nI am so disappointed that @westham still decided to play him tonight. \nThere have been so many campaigns over the years to get abuse out of football whether it be by online trolling, racial slurs or actual physical violence in the form of throwing objects onto the pitch. But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "Today is one year since my baby Thistle passed. Rest in peace sweet Thistle. I have not posted on here but I have also been working as a vet tech. Because of you Thistle I started another career helping animals, and I think of this often. Thank you for our short time together and for propelling me into a field I love. Hopefully in the future there will be successful treatments for FIP, its a devastating diagnosis and agonizing to go through. I donated again to The Winn Feline Foundation who funds a bunch of FIP research.

            "It\u2019s Lacy\u2019s 3 year cure date from FIP. I\u2019m grateful everyday that I have this silly, sassy, snuggle bug in my life. I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day. Please check out @zenbycat and think about becoming a monthly donor to help with the research \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e #fipsucks #fipsurvivor #curedoffip #formerferal #fipwarrior #fipresearch #rescuecat",

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated.

            "It\u2019s Lacy\u2019s 3 year cure date from FIP. I\u2019m grateful everyday that I have this silly, sassy, snuggle bug in my life. I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day. Please check out @zenbycat and think about becoming a monthly donor to help with the research \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e #fipsucks #fipsurvivor #curedoffip #formerferal #fipwarrior #fipresearch #rescuecat",

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance. Any contribution means a lot to me... and I\u2019m so sorry for having to post here.\nAnd also, perhaps some of you have gone through the same ordeal and could help me with the steps to follow for treatment or share your experiences.\n\nHe has wet FIP with severe symptoms, including abdominal effusion and jaundice. He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. My other cat, Tokyo, carries the disease dormant, and we hope he remains unaffected. Praying for my bb Kaiju\u2019s recovery.\n \nYou will live.

Because of you Thistle I started another career helping animals, and I think of this often. Thank you for our short time together and for propelling me into a field I love. Hopefully in the future there will be successful treatments for FIP, its a devastating diagnosis and agonizing to go through. I donated again to The Winn Feline Foundation who funds a bunch of FIP research.

I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day.

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance. Any contribution means a lot to me... and I\u2019m so sorry for having to post here.\nAnd also, perhaps some of you have gone through the same ordeal and could help me with the steps to follow for treatment or share your experiences.\n\nHe has wet FIP with severe symptoms, including abdominal effusion and jaundice. He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. My other cat, Tokyo, carries the disease dormant, and we hope he remains unaffected. Praying for my bb Kaiju\u2019s recovery.\n \nYou will live.

In the first few months of 2020, they came together to raise funds for Puerto Rico\u2019s earthquakes and Australia\u2019s bushfires. We are honored that they chose us to be a recipient of their efforts: \"The students and faculty from Puerto Rico at RUSVM mobilized our community soon after the disaster events, in an effort to raise funds to assist with relief efforts for animals in the affected areas.  The students decided to donate the monies to your organization, as it proves to be one that year after year continues to provide a holistic approach to improving animal welfare in Puerto Rico.\" Thank you so much to each and everyone of these students for their advocacy on behalf of the animals in Puerto Rico (and around the world) and for helping us save more lives. \n#thankyouthursday #satostrong #animaladvocates #studentsgivingback #youthactivism #vetstudents #studentschangingtheworld",

Because of you Thistle I started another career helping animals, and I think of this often. Thank you for our short time together and for propelling me into a field I love. Hopefully in the future there will be successful treatments for FIP, its a devastating diagnosis and agonizing to go through. I donated again to The Winn Feline Foundation who funds a bunch of FIP research.

            "It\u2019s Lacy\u2019s 3 year cure date from FIP. I\u2019m grateful everyday that I have this silly, sassy, snuggle bug in my life. I almost lost her to a horrible disease that we now have the meds for. But the meds are expensive and black market because the fda hasn\u2019t approved it. And because it\u2019s not fda approved, most vets don\u2019t know about the cure, and if they do they can\u2019t recommend the illegal cure for fear of losing their license. Research is still underway and @zenbycat is helping. I would love if the drugs could be made available to everyone that need them. I would also love if there could be a vaccine one day.

            "This isn't a fun post to make. In fact, it really sucks. \n\nIf you have been following us since the beginning, you may remember Jupiter. She was a tiny little kitten with deformed front legs that almost froze to death. One of our founders, Mallori, fought HARD to keep her alive for those touch-and-go first 24 hours. After she was stable, she was transferred to Abby, one of our board members with immense veterinary knowledge. At Abby's home, Jupiter was LOVED immensely and became Abby and Family's first \"foster fail\". Unfortunately, Jupiter had medical problem after medical problem. The decision was ultimately made to let her go peacefully from her suffering. Jupiter's family opted for a necropsy, which is the same thing as an autopsy in humans. Upon examination, doctors were able to determine that Jupiter was suffering from the dry form of FIP. \n\nWe are wanting to compile data to benefit FIP research, starting with our own kitties. If you have previously adopted from us and your cat was diagnosed or suspected to have FIP, please fill out the form located in the LinkTr.ee in our bio called \"FIP Data Collection\". If you have a cat that was diagnosed with or suspected to have FIP that was not adopted from us, you are also welcome to complete the form. We know that this form may be triggering and difficult to complete, so we thank you WHOLEHEARTEDLY in advance. \n\nYou can learn a lot more about FIP by visiting the LinkTr.ee in our bio and clicking the \"Learn More about FIP\" link.\n#FIPresearch #kittensofinstagram #kittensofaggieland #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives",

            "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in people.\n\nFeline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues, aside from mild diarrhea. But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, FIP can develop. In about 10% of infected cats, the virus will multiply and mutate, resulting in an infection known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that spreads throughout the cat\u2019s body. It can cause an extreme inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the abdomen, kidney, or brain.\n\n#felinefip #fipawarenessday #felinecoronvirus #fipresearch",

            "Today, I come with sad news. My heart is shattered as I share that my baby has been diagnosed positive for FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis). I\u2019ve created a fundraising link for those willing to help. It will be pinned in my bio. The treatment is illegal so, really expensive but offers a chance for survival. This is the only chance. Any contribution means a lot to me... and I\u2019m so sorry for having to post here.\nAnd also, perhaps some of you have gone through the same ordeal and could help me with the steps to follow for treatment or share your experiences.\n\nHe has wet FIP with severe symptoms, including abdominal effusion and jaundice. He sleeps a lot, barely moves, and can\u2019t meow. Fluid fills his internal cavities, requiring urgent action. A treatment, albeit illegal and expensive (between 2500 and 8000+ \u20ac), may help him survive. We\u2019re facing challenging costs too for daily injections, weekly vet visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds. \n\nI can\u2019t let my baby go; any support, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated.

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "Some BTS from our dopamine dressing shoot with @barnardosretail \u2728\n\nFun fact: did you know that \u201cForever yours, Betty\u201d started as a vintage side hustle? \n\nI\u2019ve been a collector of all things vintage and colourful since my teens, so by the time I hit college I ended up getting together with some like minded friends to start selling on the side at local fairs and indie shops. \n\nWe had a love for romanticising each item, creating a whole written back story of \u201cBetty\u201d. Each piece shared a snippet more about her, her life, who she was and what she was doing as well as the love and memories she had towards her entire wardrobe. We imagined her not to be selling her wares but more so sharing her stories. And so, Betty was born! \n\nIt would have been fabulous if we knew  someone called Betty wore a dress we had found while sipping a Midouri Sour with the Rocketts at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday party in 1974, but for us it was all about \u2728the fantasy\u2728 something I still automatically do with every vintage find. It may be fictional, but painting a happy exciting history just adds more fun to the whole second hand experience! \n\nBe sure to take a snap if you spot me in your local Barnados! So happy to have been asked to join such a colourful and fun bunch of creators to bring this to life!\n\n Are you a second hand romantic, or a realist?! \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc40\u2728 \n\n#dopaminedressing #secondhand #charityshop AD charity partner",

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

Sign us up!\n\nRabbit Awareness Week is an annual campaign to educate rabbit guardians on all aspects of rabbit care. This year\u2019s theme is Neutering: Protect and Prevent.\n\nAccording to our associate @rabbitatsrescue, Canadian cities contend with abandoned pets and their feral offspring, while rural areas deal with unscrupulous breeders who routinely release their unwanted stock. It\u2019s a tragedy for the loose bunnies as they will most likely be killed by predators, parasites, sport hunters, or trappers hired for \u2018pest control.\u2019 \n\nRabbitats is working to educate new rabbit guardians on low-maintenance and sustainable care, and you can learn more about rabbit care on their page!\n\n#humanecanada #raw #rabbitats #canadianrabbits #canadianbunny\n#rabbitawareness #rabbitsofcanada #animalsupporters #animalprotection #animaladvocacy",

            "Evening you lovely people. \nIt\u2019s a bit of a different post from me tonight. \nI\u2019m sure most of you have seen or heard about the horrendous video of @kurtzouma abusing his cat. \nI made the mistake of reading the news before I went to bed last night and I was so upset and sickened that I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nIt has been on my mind all day today and I feel so sad and frustrated that I can\u2019t do anything. \nIn my opinion it is a true privilege to have a pet and the unconditional love they give us is beyond compare. \nI am so disappointed that @westham still decided to play him tonight. \nThere have been so many campaigns over the years to get abuse out of football whether it be by online trolling, racial slurs or actual physical violence in the form of throwing objects onto the pitch. But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

            "I HAVE FOUND AN INJURED BIRD, WHAT DO I DO !!\n\nFor most injured birds, place them gently in a box and keep them quiet, dark and cool. It may be that the bird is in shock and will soon recover so you can let it go.\n\n If it is more seriously injured, this will reduce stress on the bird until you can get advice on how you can help it.\n\nBirds will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. \n\nSmall birds: Can be firmly held in one hand, positioning the hand over the bird so that its head is between your fore and middle fingers, letting the rest of your fingers naturally wrap around the wings.\n\nMedium birds: Use two hands, each covering a wing and a soft cloth to hold it.\n\nLarge birds: It is best to call an expert rescuer as larger birds are capable of inflicting some damage to anyone trying to handle them. \n\nChoose an adequately sized box so that the bird can move around, line it with tissues, and make sure it has a cover and air holes. Keeping the bird in the dark helps reduce stress, and a source of heat can help with shock. You can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it inside or next to the box, making sure the bird can get away from the heat if it wants to. If it begins to pant, remove the heat source immediately. \n\nDon\u2019t offer food or water without being advised by an expert to do so.\n\nFreedom is always precious and so is life...give them the life they are meant to live....\n\nRESCUE - REHABILITATE - RELEASE...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#pfa\n#pfahyderabad  #animalsmeannoharm #savelives #saveanimals #rescue #animalsupporters #animalrescuehyderabad #birdrescuehyderabad #birdrescues #helpbirds #injuredbirds #rescuebirds",

            "Evening you lovely people. \nIt\u2019s a bit of a different post from me tonight. \nI\u2019m sure most of you have seen or heard about the horrendous video of @kurtzouma abusing his cat. \nI made the mistake of reading the news before I went to bed last night and I was so upset and sickened that I couldn\u2019t sleep. \nIt has been on my mind all day today and I feel so sad and frustrated that I can\u2019t do anything. \nIn my opinion it is a true privilege to have a pet and the unconditional love they give us is beyond compare. \nI am so disappointed that @westham still decided to play him tonight. \nThere have been so many campaigns over the years to get abuse out of football whether it be by online trolling, racial slurs or actual physical violence in the form of throwing objects onto the pitch. But how can the clubs continue to campaign about any sort of abuse  when it still puts a player who has abused his cat in the team? \nJust as abuse isn\u2019t tolerated on or off the pitch for players neither should it be if they are the ones inflicting it! \nABUSE IS ABUSE and anyone who abuses an innocent animal is the lowest of the low in my opinion. \nSo I\u2019m asking any of you lovely followers who feel the same to sign the change.org petition to have him prosecuted and his beautiful cats taken away from him. @rickygervais @rspca_official @metpolice_uk @adidasfootball @bbcfootball @skysports @chrisgpackham2 @dominic_dyer1970 @gmb @thismorning @skynews @bbcnews #cats cats #catlover #stopabuse #oneruleforthem #catsofinstagram #animallovers #animalsupporters #notocruelty #abusers #petlovers #petloversofinstagram #bekind #kindnessmatters #animalsarebetterthanpeople #animalsarethebest #animalsarefamily"

Each piece shared a snippet more about her, her life, who she was and what she was doing as well as the love and memories she had towards her entire wardrobe. We imagined her not to be selling her wares but more so sharing her stories. And so, Betty was born! \n\nIt would have been fabulous if we knew  someone called Betty wore a dress we had found while sipping a Midouri Sour with the Rocketts at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday party in 1974, but for us it was all about \u2728the fantasy\u2728 something I still automatically do with every vintage find. It may be fictional, but painting a happy exciting history just adds more fun to the whole second hand experience! \n\nBe sure to take a snap if you spot me in your local Barnados! So happy to have been asked to join such a colourful and fun bunch of creators to bring this to life!\n\n Are you a second hand romantic, or a realist?! \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc40\u2728 \n\n#dopaminedressing #secondhand #charityshop AD charity partner",
